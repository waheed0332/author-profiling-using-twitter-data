On my way to Aruba for a small business retreat!
@npann It&#39;s a gorgeous piece of shit
People are so nice in Aruba. Then again, the internet rarely works: They can&#39;t offend one another so often.
I&#39;m drafting a business plan to assist in feeding my current business.
I wonder if I could gain followers if I posted pics of me in a Speedo. Could I lose followers? #Aruba
@LisaMcCray There are so many tragic Speedo sighting s here!!!!!!

It is critical in business to listen to outside opinions.
@GinaAlex Too late... I ain&#39;t lyin&#39; doe! I was on a boat and couldn&#39;t get to my phone...

@DCNOMA It really doesn&#39;t matter.
Leaving Aruba today with new goals, a clear mind and a mild hangover. I really did get a lot out of this experience with a Growth Coach.
I&#39;m so afraid to check my voicemail when I return to the States today... Client: &quot;Where the *bleep* have you been?!&quot;
Oh, I was in Aruba &quot;working on my personal growth&quot;, did you get my invoice? :-)
Does anyone want to have an off-line conversation about Andrew Bynum&#39;s hair?
Mean-mugging the Aruba locals &#39;cause they get to stay here and I have to return to the cold &gt;:-\
@undered What is wrong with that brotha?!
@undered lol. He needs Dr. Jesus. SMH

I was just invited to critique 3rd year #architecture students for the sole purpose, supporting my reputation of &quot;being mean&quot;.
@npann I won&#39;t. Trust me :-)
#grammar I meant &quot;reputation for&quot; in an earlier tweet. Forgive me!
@lila0021 @npann My favorite line: &quot;I&#39;m about to have an aneurysm!&quot;

@npann I could get capped for ranking on some student&#39;s crappy project, homie!
@npann Attempting to better utilize the site i have cc:@HopeworksDesign
I can&#39;t believe I still use AutoCAD. Then again, I can&#39;t believe people pay for REVIT and manage to remain profitable.
Every time I&#39;m around other architects I wonder: &quot;Why are these nerds so arrogant? Am I an arrogant nerd?&quot;
I&#39;m always shocked at how a house in Saint Thomas&#39; site can drop 30 feet in, like....hmmmm....30 feet horizontally. WTF?

I saw my first Galaxy Note 2 in real life today. Of course, it was a middle-aged #architect with the MONSTER device against his cranium.
If you&#39;re a black architect and you meet another black architect DON&#39;T BE A JERK. It doesn&#39;t project confidence OR competence.

Baltimore even Gerrymandered it&#39;s zip code boundaries..

@Erik_Jens Yes! Thanks.
Building partnerships, man... Simply building partnerships...
Why is Architect trying to make me PAY to find talent to hire? Please... That&#39;s just another barrier for the unemployed.

All of Baltimore is waiting to see the Ravens exact revenge on the Patriots. Baltimore revenge ain&#39;t like New England revenge... You dig?

Guy shows me an office space that is intervening space between two exits. I&#39;m an architect! No deal dude... Lol #IBC fail
Thinking about paying to respond to #thumbtack adds proposing fees of $1.00. When they respond I&#39;ll tell them to eat one.
I hate seeing other architects who include &quot;as-built&quot; plans in their submissions. Yo! As built plans are an &quot;additional service&quot;. dumb asses
@whysIdeas lol. That works too!
@DCNOMA I&#39;m opening a storefront office in Mount Vernon (Baltimore) this spring. I would love to host a NOMA meeting? May gain bmore members

@bmoreslumwatch landlord said I could sublease. Maybe I&#39;ll put a cell in there?
Idiot contractor sends me an email saying my permit drawings are &quot;vage&quot;. At least he speaks German... I hope he understands my nasty reply.
Why are most contractors illiterate? Why can&#39;t many architects spell? Why can&#39;t we all just get along?
@npann Right?! lol
@ArchRecord Can we have more articles researching economic sustainability for firms and less &quot;designer porn&quot;?

@mCase513 Yo! I saw possibly the least thought out attempt at a building since Cavemen lived. I told the student to &quot;explore other talents&quot;.
@mCase513 I see quite well and can do math. This shit was retarded...
@mCase513 3rd year. Delusion ended
Hopefully this week will lead to answered proposals!
This NBA dunk competition is more sad then the sad student project I reviewed yesterday...

&quot;@WishingRockHome: @bmorearchitect That&#39;s ok. I bet 20 of them were solicitors worth missing&quot; truly
When calling an architect for the first time never brag about your wealth. I&#39;m just going to raise my fee.
Dear permit review: Please review my project so I can get paid. THX
Are conservatives bitching about Barack Obama wasting his day and &quot;their tax money&quot; dedicating a library to someone who can&#39;t read? #bush
@donnabrazile lol. politicians sure can lie with grace :-)
Famous people act like they&#39;re too good to respond to my tweets. The nerve!
Bill collectors: Don&#39;t call me 8 times a day. It&#39;s not like I have a hidden trust fund from which to pull. Call my delinquent clients!

The George W. Bush Presidential Center was clearly designed in 1984 using an Autocad digitizer pad.
The more I learn about building technology, the more I give modern architecture the skeptical side eye :-/

I can&#39;t believe Charles Ramsey is so much a part of my life.
I seem to possess a special skill for pissing off other #architects. This has been evident since day one. Alas, I work alone...
I giggle at #architects who believe they can snoop about and micromanage trades and other industry specialists.
If you aren&#39;t emailing me today about an incoming wire transfer don&#39;t bother. 

Thanks,

@RGIII Because most people aren&#39;t NFL players and work real jobs that tend to suck...
@Lisarme Real architects can balance the need for efficiency versus economy of systems. R-20 is overkill
@Lisarme perhaps
@Lisarme Canadians are smart and optimistic. Do it!
@Lisarme I&#39;m Scottish (McCray). Lol
@afrolicious Illiteracy :-)
@afrolicious idk. You asked for the problem. Illiteracy is a HUGE prollim (especially in the hood)...
@afrolicious Nah. I&#39;m an architect. I can&#39;t write... I guess I&#39;m trolling? Lol

One thing I hate about residential architectural projects: Coming up with bullshit names to give rooms, like &quot;mud room&quot; and &quot;guest suite&quot;.
@npann Well, I have historical reasons as to why I refuse to call it &quot;master&quot;!
I&#39;m voting for white males ONLY from now on. I miss the days of political harmony and discrimination. Life was soooo much easier. You know?

@EBroda @npann @a_antonellis @MrsThibbz To be clear: I use other shit (Archicad &amp; REVIT), but I&#39;m more profitable with 2D CAD, just curious
@EBroda @npann @a_antonellis @MrsThibbz Ever since I started by biz, it totally changed my relationship with software.
@npann @EBroda @a_antonellis @MrsThibbz  When I use BIM I make my clients pay for the shit (at least 50% of the software). FUG that!
@threefourteen @npann @EBroda @a_antonellis @MrsThibbz  Good ?: Larger clients tend to require BIM. It&#39;s an Add. Service in the AIA Docs.$$$
@threefourteen @npann @EBroda @a_antonellis @MrsThibbz I disagree. BIM software is WAY more expensive than other means of production.
@threefourteen @npann @EBroda @a_antonellis @MrsThibbz My attorney doesn&#39;t give me any breaks, so I do biz like an attorney. No freebies.
@threefourteen @npann @EBroda @a_antonellis @MrsThibbz I&#39;ve been on BIM since 2007ish. The software is just costly and cumbersome for most.
@threefourteen @npann @EBroda @a_antonellis @MrsThibbz AIA ain&#39;t gonna let that happen within the contract docs anytime soon. Trust me...
@beornborg @threefourteen fuck no. lol
@npann @threefourteen @EBroda @a_antonellis @MrsThibbz agree
@beornborg @threefourteen I empathize...

@MrsThibbz @monkeybrief  Not to talk cars, but I got stuck in the hood on a hill until an angelic plow saved me. Followed him outta trouble

@edmcolon Some fool just called to lecture me about fire alarm design, braggin&#39; about his &quot;25 years of experience&quot;. Hung up on him...
@edmcolon I might actually use that one!

On my way to Aruba for a small business retreat!
@npann It&#39;s a gorgeous piece of shit
People are so nice in Aruba. Then again, the internet rarely works: They can&#39;t offend one another so often.
I&#39;m drafting a business plan to assist in feeding my current business.
I wonder if I could gain followers if I posted pics of me in a Speedo. Could I lose followers? #Aruba
@LisaMcCray There are so many tragic Speedo sighting s here!!!!!!

Leaving Aruba today with new goals, a clear mind and a mild hangover. I really did get a lot out of this experience with a Growth Coach.
I&#39;m so afraid to check my voicemail when I return to the States today... Client: &quot;Where the *bleep* have you been?!&quot;
Oh, I was in Aruba &quot;working on my personal growth&quot;, did you get my invoice? :-)
Does anyone want to have an off-line conversation about Andrew Bynum&#39;s hair?

At Morgan State for juries. Oh! The campus is on lock down. Shooting :-(
Had a website consultation today with @HopeworksDesign . She really knows her stuff!
@npann I could get capped for ranking on some student&#39;s crappy project, homie!
@npann Attempting to better utilize the site i have cc:@HopeworksDesign
I can&#39;t believe I still use AutoCAD. Then again, I can&#39;t believe people pay for REVIT and manage to remain profitable.
Every time I&#39;m around other architects I wonder: &quot;Why are these nerds so arrogant? Am I an arrogant nerd?&quot;
I&#39;m always shocked at how a house in Saint Thomas&#39; site can drop 30 feet in, like....hmmmm....30 feet horizontally. WTF?

If you&#39;re a black architect and you meet another black architect DON&#39;T BE A JERK. It doesn&#39;t project confidence OR competence.
