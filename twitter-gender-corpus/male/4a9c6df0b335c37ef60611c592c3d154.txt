@Hostgator broke my site in the process of transferring me to dedicated hosting from shared. It&#39;s still down. Bad service. Poorly trained.
@wizardprang Yep - @Hostgator has totally screwed up my upgrade to a more expensive hosting plan. Sorry for the problems they have created.
@hostgator - Still having problems. Front end appears to be back, but can&#39;t log in to admin. Getting error messages.
@w3edge Is Total Cache compatible with DB Cache Reloaded? Should I use that plugin to add speed?
I think the site is live. Lost comments over the last 3-4 days, unfortunately. Let me know if you run into problems. Tweets inspire results.
@w3edge Does it do everything and more? They claim to be the fastest, but everyone claims that. Or are all types of DB caching the same.
