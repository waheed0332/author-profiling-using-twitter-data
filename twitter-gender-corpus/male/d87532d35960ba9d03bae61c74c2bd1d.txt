@DebbieEvansID good idea, nothing wrong with that. I did the same many many years ago.
Camping was off the charts. Tomorrow checking out a new project for the fall list and wrapping up a few small projects.
@marcmcpherson @artsyshell
@marcmcpherson @artsyshell I&#39;m on that pal in the fall buddy.
Love this summer weather. No rain means mad progress on the site
@finewallfinish will be working through the summer.
@Dotandscreed Hey wanna pick your brain on an old-school plaster technique.
@Dotandscreed how would you go about plastering this without using drywall.
@Dotandscreed u get my ?
@Dotandscreed I have a client that wants these curved coved ceilings finished old school style.pic.twitter.com/jV6Fp0Hx
@Dotandscreed weld what !! I was thinking diamond lath an treating with scratch &amp; brown creating a jig to the profile.
@Dotandscreed yup I agree does, Diamond lath with a drywall compound mixed with fibers and silica
@Dotandscreed yes
@Dotandscreed @tedmuller diamond lath is a metal mesh looks like chicken wire.
@Dotandscreed @tedmuller my plan is to screw the lath to the contour of the wood then go over it.
@Dotandscreed @tedmuller @plas66jatc oh boys sounds like I should just use 1/8 inch drywall cut into pizza slices and tape all the seams.
@TedMuller why not ?
@TedMuller ya I figured that. We are plastering the full interior so the builder just wanted me to handle everything.
@TedMuller yes sir I do agree. Just want to do it and make it last forever. 
Why don&#39;t you think 1/8 inch drywall will work btw
Waiting for new clients from West Van to come see the current villa to talk interior exterior lime plaster for there project.
@TedMuller brilliant idea. Think I need to prep the wood substrate with anything before I put lath up ?
@TedMuller ok wicked I&#39;ll run some ideas then. Thx
@TedMuller if the budget fits we will do the Interior this fall. No on the exterior they will be 12 by 24 limestone tiles.
@Dotandscreed @tedmuller true that.
@milestones in Yaletown with family and friends. Road the Ducati, 1st night drive tonight.
@Dotandscreed shellac or primer.
@TedMuller @dotandscreed I love all your input and I&#39;m going to use a little bit of everyone&#39;s ideas and suggestions.
@Dotandscreed @tedmuller that I will for sure. This builder must love me. Every challenge we get we over come and move on.
Nothing like being able to work on your own bike to feel well rounded. Bring on Monday I&#39;m ready to work.pic.twitter.com/t2gumSYb
@Dotandscreed @tedmuller looking like we won&#39;t tackle those ceilings till January. End result is classic Venetian

@TedMuller most of these guy work exclusive for this builder they work the repairs into the original quote.
@TedMuller yes that would be awesome. We just build a path overtop with plywood and tie it all in.

Here is a quick video of the sill mod

This is a sill Installed on the 1st curved window.pic.twitter.com/GBwNKGFE
@TedMuller yea they should have made them that way but everyone go into a pissing contest of who was wrong or right. 1/2
@TedMuller engineer rejected the design from supplier and we came up with a way to meet his demands. At an extra cost of corse.
@TedMuller I just want to finish this job this season to many projects geared up for next year to wait for a resolution, so fabricate we go
@TedMuller I think the supplier has dropped the ball. These windows have no flashing under the widows. The sill is suppose 2 b cladding
@TedMuller supplier says every installer  fabricates them I find that hard to believe. I won&#39;t be installing them again.
Looking forward to an uninterrupted day of work on the villa by my self without the crew lots of lime painting needs my attention.
@TedMuller funny enough I don&#39;t even want to install foam mouldings. You know my work. We took it on cause no other company&#39;s would I c y

@TedMuller weather sucks. Lots of rain 
Tomorrow is only day of sun for a week. 
So I&#39;m going for a full day ride.
@dcofva no sir, I&#39;d likely have to modify one to make that happen. The hose for Graco is the size of a garden hose airbrush is super small
@dcofva how about u why u need an airbrush help 9.5 wont accomplish what u need?
@dcofva I don&#39;t see how you could hook that up to the 9.5 
Better of buying the stand alone unite u showed me. For 400$ that&#39;s a good deal
@dcofva I&#39;ve never seen the need for an airbrush it&#39;s never been needed in my projects. I just layer with glaze and thin as needed
Wow super stressful day. 7 jobs sites in one day. Working hard to keep everyone happy.
@MarmoSurrey nice work. But I&#39;d appreciate it if you changed your profile photo from one of my projects.
@MarmoSurrey it&#39;s all good. That job took forever its published in a book in Canada don&#39;t want people to get confused
