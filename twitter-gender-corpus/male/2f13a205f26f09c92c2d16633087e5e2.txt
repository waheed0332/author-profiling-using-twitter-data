@crondavid Do you have Perkstreet?  If so, why PerkStreet over Ally?
@perkstreet Clearly, your customer service is amazing.  Out of sheer curiosity, who do you consider to be your biggest competitor?
@theitbros Did you ever have to overcome the withdrawal limits from @perkstreet (at ATMs)?  If so, what options did you use?
@gameopen My wife has Smart Financial CU and we&#39;ve had so many problems.  She&#39;s had debit cards disabled (hacking), random bill payments,etc
@allybank Great advantage!  Rewards: with 5K in the bank and 2K monthly spending, I calculate yearly savings at $250 vs Perkstreet&#39;s $480
@allybank @perkstreet picks up the phone within 30 seconds(on average).  Do you have a figure for average time? Cust Service is king for me!
