Some people talk about the fact we have ads on the blog. To write a post takes a long time, especially to find content, that&#39;s why the ads.
@fwa totally agree. Besides, other sharing like Twitter, FB and Pinterest make money from ads too. Why then is it okay?
@grantfriedman we got an issue this weekend. For them, apparently ads means we are taking advantage of other people&#39;s work.
@fwa exactly!
@awesomerobot @signalnoise I agree with you, but just ask to remove. Besides, we use content from a social site that incentive that.
@awesomerobot @signalnoise if you want your content safe. Don&#39;t share it on social networks.
@awesomerobot @signalnoise besides, why is it okay sharing on Pinterest without permission and it&#39;s not on a blog?
@awesomerobot @signalnoise this services make much more money than any blog via ads an referral codes. And some blogs are older than those
@awesomerobot @signalnoise true. Well, I am just sad, that&#39;s all.
@awesomerobot @signalnoise I agree with that.
Just want to say thank you all for the great conversation. We&#39;re all learning by trial and error in a way.
Mistakes can be made. Let&#39;s keep it respectful and classy. I believe nobody has bad intentions, just different points of view.
