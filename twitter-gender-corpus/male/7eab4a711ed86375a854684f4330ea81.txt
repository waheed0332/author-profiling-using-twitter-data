@fmailhot we will write papers and submit for publication, but there is a process, so I can&#39;t say what we used until that has happened.

@dianesaysword Went earlier, vistrs arrvng at 4:30. 3D high frame rate added nothing. Story well done. Video game bits silly as per usual.
Well-crafted, maybe a little dated. Martin Beck is a sympathetic protagonist. http://amzn.com/k/3X6GI7xJT2aL7aHNgfbsPA&nbsp;…
@kbaker218 I guess that deals with the incomplete :-)
@pennymitv All is well with US Brews. (cf eg #www.jamiebrew.com) John Brew,  82,not in good shape, Hilda and daughters bearing much strain,
@ccb Our book, http://amzn.to/XzcmMF&nbsp;, is definitely accessible, less technical, more application-focused than Charniak. Both?
@chris_brockett @ccb Yes to nltk. And there&#39;s a lot of community-created support material out there for it.
@lousylinguist -ing words are thought tricky because three ways ambiguous between NN|JJ|VBG in treebank. Solution: who cares? don&#39;t decide.
@jadler This is a #linguistsexample of #ambiguity. The words alone don&#39;t say who she wanted to do the homework. Could be you or her.
@pennymitv SpinningJenny actually produced yarn for the weavers to use. Analogy more  apt than S knows. Online feeds and allows better TV.
@dianesaysword fleerrghgh!
@KatCarmOSU We stayed near Fanore, in County Clare. Very pretty. Go to Crotty&#39;s, Kilrush, say hi to my cousin Rebecca and her husband Kevin.
@jasonbaldridge It&#39;s really only the .mutable that makes this credible. .immutable is way too idealistic.

@haldaume3 @JDCHOI btw, my package for clear NLP uses multiple cores via Thrift if it can, so check CPU budget bearing that in mind.
@haldaume3 @earnmyturns Malt is not THAT scary. We like it, but clearnlp is looking good to us. Excited for @yoavgo&#39;s new one.
@dianesaysword @barry_oneill @Dan_S_Blanchard  London, Berlin just the same.

Twelve Tones: http://youtu.be/4niz8TfY794&nbsp; via @youtube. Vi Hart branches out from math into music, cogsci and EVERYTHING. So engaging...
@lousylinguist Why not learn new school NLP, rather than changing fields altogether?

@JustKatCarm Article from 2005. Attitudes have changed, I hope. Do a Ph.D for its value to YOU NOW. Not as a career move.

@yoavgo I feel your pain, but actually the standard has improved hugely. There was one dodgy one today, 40 like that at Coling &#39;90.
@makotokanazawa I believe so, and it means &#39;the number of planets is not even. I take no position on whether the reply is true.
@yoavgo  True about Q&amp;A
@ShlomoArgamon @heatherfro @louBurnard A burst of phoneticians. An alignment of MTers. A strict layer of metrical phonologists.
@Atreys The thing you&#39;ve got to realize is that you can totally trust your gut reactions on this.
@deevybee @bgzimmer &quot;animadversary&quot; was already a word, now it is also a bracketing paradox.
@yoavgo @jasonbaldridge @ccb Citations are themselves a proxy. Impact = your work positively influences the work of others.

@jonathanstark @zelandiya hm. word2vec is for counting,  sending counts to (maybe deep) machine learning . The article is confused on this.

@j2bryson @lintool Of course it&#39;s a well written piece. He has access to the best writers in Russia.
@j2bryson @lintool But if it helps to prevent good people from causing unnecessary suffering, I don&#39;t care whether the writer is despicable.

@j2bryson @lintool No, I can&#39;t tell for sure. The effects could be bad. But I said if ...
@j2bryson @lintool Pretty sure US bombing will be counterproductive, and increase suffering, so against it.
@j2bryson @lintool Putin op-ed is repellent, but could be effective in helping Obama avoid the trap of unilateral intervention.
@j2bryson @lintool International effort to destroy chemical weapons likely messy and ineffective. Only good solution requires time machine.
@TPM US situation so messy that it is really hard to find intelligence, collect it in one place, and put it under international control.
@pennymitv Not so fast. Online is good for multiple choice, writing, but not diagrams, eqns, graphs: hard to test math or science fairly.
@j2blather @KZhitomi @francescrook look at &quot;Other Lives&quot; for a bit of balance.
@conjugateprior Rechtschreibreform was a wonderful success, so you want to do it again?
@conjugateprior Spelling bridges pronunciation differences, and signals etymology and word structure. Transparent sound mapping is overrated

@jasonbaldridge busy? would be happy to hang out.
@jasonbaldridge  No, but could easily drive up.
@nsaphra @jasonbaldridge on-your-kneeness
@nsaphra @jasonbaldridge is there a big market for that?
New trend: CAT-fooding the company technology. Nibbling at it in a desultory way before mewing for something better.
@j2bryson @conjugateprior By that argument free-market capitalism is also dead, bc everyone supporting it is abusing it. Plausible!
@conjugateprior @j2bryson Cartels, guilds, monopolies, monopsonies. Everyone wants to freely compete, but not in THEIR BIT of the market.
@pennymitv @johnc1912 There will be both false positives (flagged as child abuse, but isn&#39;t) and false negatives (not flagged, but is).
@pennymitv @johnc1912 Crucial to get right what happens with such errors. We don&#39;t want e.g. teachers fired when search engine gets it wrong
@JustKatCarm Coming from an all-male school, I certainly take to heart the recommendation about nuns.
