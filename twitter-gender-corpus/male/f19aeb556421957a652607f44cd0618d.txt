Why do white people want to be &quot;ratchet&quot; so bad? And why are they abusing the word 6 years after Hurricane Chris sadly introduced it?
Can we leave the twerking to @Ciara? PLEAAASSSEEEE!!!

&quot;To be interested in the changing seasons is a happier state of mind than to be hopelessly in love with spring.&quot; -George Santayana
Let&#39;s set the record straight. Twerking has been around since the 90&#39;s. Why is it such a new phenomenon all of a sudden?
I guess @diplo is probably responsible for making twerking popular on a National and if not an international level
&quot;No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking.&quot; -Voltaire

@melismaticdiva Funny thats my least favorite track from a production perspective but &quot;Who Are You&quot; is my fav from a writing perspective
@melismaticdiva It&#39;s crazy cause I didn&#39;t know 4 of them are Bruno Mars&#39; sisters
@melismaticdiva oh maybe that&#39;s what it is. I&#39;m mistaken then. Thanks for clearing that up
@melismaticdiva You saw the TLC movie lol It&#39;s going to be HARD to see that again but I feel you on the UK statement
@melismaticdiva Noone likes being broke for long and the days of selling 10 million are long gone. Except for with Bruno Mars &amp; Eminem
@melismaticdiva NYSNC selling a million in one day had to be part of a grand marketing plan where the label bought a lot of those albums
@melismaticdiva Who&#39;s the biggest selling Pop group of all time?
@melismaticdiva I just looked it up. Top selling Boy Bands: 1.Backstreet Bys 2. Jackson Five 3. NKOTB 4. The Osmonds 5. Bay City Rollers
@melismaticdiva And your 3 girl groups were exactly right. #4 is Bananarama and #5 is AKB48
@melismaticdiva Yup #6 is another J-Pop group &quot;Speed&quot; then the Supremes. Crazy. I can&#39;t believe that

Man I swear @sia is one of the best writers in pop &amp; EDM music right now. @britneyspears&#39;s song #Perfume is nuts. Shouts to Chris Braide too
@OneMusicPortal Favorite song by Sia? Prob. Hands down She Wolf. Throwback Sia favorite is &quot;Clap Your Hands&quot;
@OneMusicPortal favorite song on the #BritneyJean album then #Perfume and I just found out that&#39;s her second single today so no bias there
Another big inspiration of mine as a songwriter is @antonypreston .- Great job with the vocal producing on the #BritneyJean album!
To all my fans who have been waiting for the Inglish 101 EP I promise it will be coming the top of the year.
Really proud of the 3 other songs I&#39;ve recorded along with #RealityShow and #DanceDruggie but the new tracks will be my best work to date
In the meantime, Ive been songwriting for other artists alongside producers Davenport&amp;Spencer &amp; @djblackout in preparation for 2014
Ive mostly been writing female pop records which is new for me but I&#39;m really excited to shop these records first quarter. #ItsGoingDown

@peteymajik Hope you enjoyed the Cronut man :)
Merry Christmas to all my #InglishMajors Love you guys!!!
@THEmrMEOLA I really think we should get the song played at Minecon somehow. How can we make that happen?
@TWC is always lying about their internet speeds in their commercials. I wanna know what country they&#39;re referring to cause is not the U.S.
@THEmrMEOLA Yeah. I mean I&#39;m sure we can still get it played next year but either way that&#39;s amazing
@THEmrMEOLA yeah that would definitely be a great idea. Maybe get them to use it in their ad campaigns.

Why do white people want to be &quot;ratchet&quot; so bad? And why are they abusing the word 6 years after Hurricane Chris sadly introduced it?

Let&#39;s set the record straight. Twerking has been around since the 90&#39;s. Why is it such a new phenomenon all of a sudden?
I guess @diplo is probably responsible for making twerking popular on a National and if not an international level

@melismaticdiva Funny thats my least favorite track from a production perspective but &quot;Who Are You&quot; is my fav from a writing perspective
@melismaticdiva It&#39;s crazy cause I didn&#39;t know 4 of them are Bruno Mars&#39; sisters
@melismaticdiva oh maybe that&#39;s what it is. I&#39;m mistaken then. Thanks for clearing that up
@melismaticdiva You saw the TLC movie lol It&#39;s going to be HARD to see that again but I feel you on the UK statement
@melismaticdiva Noone likes being broke for long and the days of selling 10 million are long gone. Except for with Bruno Mars &amp; Eminem
@melismaticdiva NYSNC selling a million in one day had to be part of a grand marketing plan where the label bought a lot of those albums
@melismaticdiva Who&#39;s the biggest selling Pop group of all time?
@melismaticdiva I just looked it up. Top selling Boy Bands: 1.Backstreet Bys 2. Jackson Five 3. NKOTB 4. The Osmonds 5. Bay City Rollers
@melismaticdiva And your 3 girl groups were exactly right. #4 is Bananarama and #5 is AKB48
@melismaticdiva Yup #6 is another J-Pop group &quot;Speed&quot; then the Supremes. Crazy. I can&#39;t believe that
