Been putting lots of cool reviews up on the http://www.Dvelop.TV&nbsp; YouTube channel! Appreciate the views and subs! :)http://youtube.com/dveloptv&nbsp;
@MrBozon I see what you did there...
@JoolsWatsham What on Earth do symbols above the door mean?! Have I collected everything or not?… http://instagram.com/p/bCPPjfyeRR/&nbsp;
@JoolsWatsham Referring to the first door btw.
@JoolsWatsham Okay, so first door has everything collected then? Appreciate the response! Some things Gold vs Some Things Blue = confusing
@m_borgmeijer @pelpina I&#39;m glad you like them, Morgan! Always fun to meet people with similar interests :D

@Sycoraxic98 I don&#39;t see many games at all launching in July on any platform, seeing something I&#39;m not?
Finally saw the @ConanOBrien E3 segment. Asked Major Nelson to sell the XBOne &amp; he said &quot;The Kinect can see your heart beat&quot; ...Really?
@therealcliffyb Not on my worldwide trends it isnt....
@therealcliffyb Annddd there it is!
Incoming Animal Crossing New Leaf rant..... So I have this stupid hippo named Hippeaux in my town.... I wanted him to move.
I did everything in my power - which means ignore him completely. He comes up to me finally and says &quot;I&#39;m leaving, just wanted to tell you.&quot;
So I was like &quot;Ok, thanks.&quot; and he&#39;s all shocked that I&#39;m okay with it. Really, Hippeaux?!
So he says &quot;Nevermind, I think we can be better friends. I&#39;m staying.&quot; DUDE! I HATE YOU! LEAVE! What kind of crap is that?! #ACNL

@TheBitBlock That game was incredible and I thought it was cool they let EA use their characters. Shows a good relationship, like LEGO City

Went to go buy Pikmin 3 at Wal-Mart, I didn&#39;t see it on shelves. So I asked if they had it, a new game for the Wii U. &quot;You mean the Wii?&quot;
They tried twice to correct me. I said Wii U, and they insisted it was the Wii.
@AeroEchelon Right? I was like.. really?
@IvanDashSmith @NE_austin Didn&#39;t @DoubleFine self-publish &quot;The Cave&quot; on the Wii U? I thought I read that...
@hiuhime I considered it for a couple of minutes.
@IvanDashSmith @NE_austin Thanks for clarification. Now I feel like playing The Cave
@hiuhime Hahahaha!!! If only it were that simple!! You&#39;re making me reconsider though :P
@IvanDashSmith Any idea who I&#39;d get in touch with about press contact/possibly reviewing Duck Tales? Thanks ahead of time!
@IvanDashSmith Appreciate it! Was going through their site and it kicked me off press page but I&#39;ll try again. Thanks! @Capcom_Unity

Talking to a friend who&#39;s been playing in the Batman Arkham Origins multiplayer beta. Now I&#39;m really sad Wii U isn&#39;t getting MP.
Honestly, as a consumer, it&#39;d be really hard for me to choose the Wii U version of Batman Arkham Origins over other platforms. @WB_Games
But honestly, how do publishers like @WB_Games expect the Wii U version of Batman to sell when it&#39;s missing an entire mode? This is stupid.
IDK if it&#39;s because it&#39;s late and I&#39;m tired, but I&#39;m really frustrated with the Wii U right now. Even with Pikmin 3 sitting in front of me.
@RichIGN You really think DK is a top-seller? The first one, sure - because of nostalgia but will reaction to the sequel will be the same?
@meRyDoon Why are Viners so worried about hate comments? Seriously - the only community I see give haters so much attention. :(
@RichIGN You ever watch Digimon? #NuffSaid
@crankycraig Possibly too many trees in one &quot;acre.&quot; That&#39;s what it looks like at least. Game limits you.

@Drzgamer Negative. Available for replay though!
Yes, TW101 Demo is out in NA,  but so is Art Academy Sketchpad! Where&#39;s the love?! @NintenDaan

@kyle1point0 Indeed there is!!!
@RichIGN Streaming is the future. Also, probably pointless, but if you haven&#39;t seen Trigun, get on that.
@RichIGN If you&#39;re getting FMAB in JP w/ Eng Sub - Amazon has it for 30.
@rikkipoynter Chobits is a WONDERFUL manga series, but I hated the anime! Hope you like it more.
@rikkipoynter Ahhh! Good idea! If you haven&#39;t seen Trigun, I&#39;d totally hop on that train as well.
@rikkipoynter Also, on the Chobits manga: I cannot express how beautiful it is. Here it is for 30$http://www.amazon.com/Chobits-Boxed-Set-Vol-1/dp/1591828376/ref=sr_1_11?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376287714&amp;sr=1-11&amp;keywords=chobits&nbsp;…
@RichIGN Dude. Avatar, S1 is 22 on amazon and FMA:B is 30! #Math What are you doing!?!
@rikkipoynter Hahahahaha!!!! In Chobits?? I think you made it farther than I did! Trigun. DO IT!
@rikkipoynter Impressed. I&#39;ll check out Gunslinger Girl since it&#39;s on Netflix! But you need to see Trigun eventually. (Also on Netflix) :)
@rikkipoynter Trigun is told from the point of view of a woman about a very &quot;dangerous&quot; man :-)

Xbox One no longer requires Kinect to be constantly connected. In other words, Microsoft has completely flipped all their stupid decisions.
.@The_Baconbitz You can do more than turn it off. You can now unplug the Kinect entirely from the Xbox One and still use your console.
@rikkipoynter Knack has me excited because it reminds me of Spyro, as far as design philosophy goes.
HA! As @inthedark_isee &amp; @The_Baconbitz quickly pointed out to me - the only stupid decision left is the price, which hasn&#39;t changed.
@shribr @RobertJFClarke Negative, they&#39;ve flipped on that as well. The Xbox no longer requires a constant online connection.
@Alex_dlc @RobertJFClarke Hahah yes, this is true! And unfortunately you are paying for it.. but at least you it&#39;s not constantly watching.
@The_Baconbitz @inthedark_isee @Drzgamer It may not be required, but incl. in the box means more people are likely to plug it in for fun.

@NintenDaan Sorry, but WMV MUST go! Plenty of conversion tools out there. Maybe this one will serve you well. http://www.h264encoder.com/&nbsp;
@NintenDaan Understandable, but the reason files are smaller is because they are more compressed.
@NintenDaan This compression is then converted to MPEG4 H.264 through YouTube, and thus your result is pixelation.
@Drzgamer Account got hacked?
@Drzgamer I don&#39;t think that was @hootsuite | Another company stole your password and used Hootsuite to post that tweet.
You can bet your pretty little faces this is happening right now. Congrats on the launch, @WayForward @IvanDashSmithpic.twitter.com/qBfy58dfjN
@Drzgamer Yes, these attacks are usually not a single-victim crime. I recommend changing your password. I&#39;ve used Hootsuite for years.
@karajanae @cwgabriel Agreed - a completely emotion experience. A true example of fine gaming.

@alexmonney Same here!!! I think I&#39;m getting it on Wii U - what about you?
Looks like no Collectors Edition of Batman Arkham Origins for Wii U! Thanks @WB_Games!!
@rikkipoynter Why not use your iPhone? It shoots in 1080p, a great video cam from my experience
@rikkipoynter bummer!! :( hope your computer has a quick recovery. What kind of cam do you normally use?
@rikkipoynter Yay Canon! :) good camera.
@rikkipoynter Heh, those flip screens do come in handy. I use a Canon T3i and XF 100 primarily, both with flip-screens &lt;3 but rarely use it.
God damn it, @Ubisoft MT @Drzgamer It&#39;s the same deal with Watch Dogs, no Collector&#39;s Edition for Wii U either.

@JATactor Hey friend! Is that you doing some voices in the new &quot;Disney Infinity&quot; game? If not, sure sounds like you haha
@TheBitBlock Agreed - it&#39;s so beautiful and SO Disney. Even down to the music. It feels like fireworks night at the parks.
@cwgabriel Mmmm, teal and magenta. One of my favorite color combos. So 80&#39;s retro.
I&#39;m wondering how much Disney Infinity content is on the disc. I&#39;m guesing all of it and I really want to know how much they have planned
There are inevitable sequels in the works, I&#39;m sure. Disney Infinity: Princesses? Etc. They&#39;re gonna milk this one good, I&#39;m sure.
And just like that, all the characters on the Disney Infinity disc are found! IDK how they are going to make such a small list last.
My guess is we&#39;ll see a sequel for the holiday season.. is that too soon?
@IvanDashSmith How much are they usually?
@IvanDashSmith Interesting!!! That&#39;s quite a good deal... Too bad the launch lineup is pretty weak lol.

@Emi1yRogers Super Mario 3D Land was the best Mario gave I&#39;ve played in a LONG time and glad it&#39;s getting the &quot;Big Console&quot; treatment.
@JoolsWatsham @Emi1yRogers The best levels in Galaxy/Galaxy 2 were the levels designed like Mario 64/3D Land. Gameplay wise, I&#39;m stoked.
In case you missed, here&#39;s the http://www.dvelop.tv&nbsp; review for DuckTales Remastered @WayForward @IvanDashSmith https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hz-0Pu_zRw&nbsp;…
@trace501 @NatGeo Do you mean Afghan Girl? It&#39;s pretty close!!
There are no words. http://instagram.com/p/dUv-dCyeQ_/&nbsp;
@jaimewoo Oh my glob, why would you do that to yourself?! Is it any good? Does NOT look appetizing....
@NintenDaan Killer Instinct? That robot game?
@rikkipoynter Question: As someone HOH, do you make the effort to add captions to your own videos? Or rely on YouTubes auto service?
@rikkipoynter Also, what about watching? Do you avoid videos where you can&#39;t turn CC on?
@rikkipoynter Who&#39;s PPL? Short for people? Thanks for insight. Going to work on captioning my videos from here on out. Helps with search too
Those hating on Affleck must&#39;ve never seen Dogma, Good Will Hunting, Argo or The Town. He&#39;s a brilliant actor (and director.)
@AngryJoeShow @wowcrendor seems to be on and off. Just uploaded 26 HD videos and each processed just fine.
Hey Disney, how are those &quot;random&quot; disc packs working for you? Oh, me? Don&#39;t worry about it... :( http://instagram.com/p/dWusVESeRU/&nbsp;
@Sweg Funny I just left!
Currently listening to the entire Beatles collection on shuffle. Are there any Beatles songs you&#39;d consider to be bad? Can&#39;t think of one.
@MichaelKYabs haha seriously?! I have a hard time believing this!

Good call, iPod.... Damn good call... http://instagram.com/p/dcX4CDyeWj/&nbsp;
@cwgabriel @DisneyInfinity Unless DLC, nothing new is coming to the game. Even the sets of figures they have planned are already in the game
@GCNStorm @Chad_Concelmo Agree with this 100%. Amazing title. We just published our review for it not too long ago | http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsVlnoElshk&nbsp;…
New Super Luigi U is available today @ retail. Here&#39;s the Dvelop.TV Review! | http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZYpeWk-po8&nbsp;…
@Impulse3000 No, there will definitely be a sequel by next year. They&#39;ve already announced all they have planned for the current Infinity
@Impulse3000 Like I said, unless it&#39;s DLC, but the dev has already said that DLC is not familiar enough with the commoner audience.
@NE_austin Your show is fantastic but I just want you to fix the white balance on your camera so badly. Please??
@Zachanner needz moar Shitty Bane
@NE_austin Haha fair enough... but for real, everything is very yellow. See diagram.pic.twitter.com/UFtfKOuP0P
@NE_austin Is the cloth behind you manilla colored? Or is it supposed to be white?
@NE_austin Interesting! Well just trying to help :) Here&#39;s some color from things I think are supposed to be whitepic.twitter.com/TCRjEx0cvy
@NE_austin Cap of thing in the background, some of your shirt, and eyes.
@TheBitBlock Have you had a chance to try the Online for Disney Infinity? Want to give it a go sometime?
@TheBitBlock Cool! Let me know when you&#39;re interested. Working on a review as well so wanna make sure I try the online portions.
.@LisaMarieMary Oh heck yes! You know we have a new #BreakingBad in 10 mins!!! :) :) :)
AMC - take a God Damn hint. I don&#39;t give a single care about Low Winter Sun.
@juliejaynak you mean the millions of people who tuned in for an Nsync reunion? Yeah I think they&#39;ll be alright.
.@Hyperfludd Level-5 doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing with the Layton brand except it&#39;s popular so crank out more games. See: Layton Bros.
@DtoidChris Infinity DLC?
@AndrewEisen Wrong, there&#39;s one character and 290 skins.
@DtoidChris been looking all over and don&#39;t see anything about Disney Infinity DLC.. Elaborate?
@DtoidChris Oh - that doesn&#39;t count, it&#39;s already built into the game! :P
@DtoidChris I think we&#39;ve forgotten what DLC stands for then. I refuse to take part in this incorrect use of terminology!
Today in a nutshell. 1.) Young females need better role-models 2.) Old ppl think &quot;molly&quot; is cocaine 3.) America has horrible taste in TV.
If you chose the VMAs over Breaking Bad, there&#39;s a part of me that dislikes you. Same rule applies to Honey Booboo &amp; anything Kardashian.
@rikkipoynter You may not get breaks there at the auto store, but you might get brakes!! #BadTimeForAGoodJoke
@rikkipoynter Hope things pick up! ( And I don&#39;t mean no truck! )
@therealcliffyb We can all learn from that first quote. RE: Joss article.
@MeaganFinnerty Dat Lana Del Rey song!
@kyle1point0 1.) Of course I am! 2.) The latest drug on the streets, I feel it&#39;s important to know what people are exposed to...
@kyle1point0 3) those aren&#39;t pulling as many views as Kardashians, VMAs, etc - unfortunately.
Gatsby by the pool? Alright then.https://vine.co/v/hihbmBBZV0b&nbsp;
So I guess this Smash Bros list is now debunked? http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=78023917&amp;postcount=3588&nbsp;…
@Jenn_naay How did you post those?
@TronKnotts @Emi1yRogers W101 is incredibly easy to market, but company behind their marketing is over-complicating. Hence a 5min &quot;trailer.&quot;
@TronKnotts @Emi1yRogers They&#39;re trying to shove too much down the consumers throat, instead of letting them discover for themselves.
@TronKnotts @Emi1yRogers No way, kids love that kind of stuff. Best place to put ads is before things like power rangers, beyblade, etc.
@TronKnotts @Emi1yRogers Power Rangers is on it&#39;s 20th season, they were in the Macy&#39;s Day Parade, and toys continue to sell like crazy.
@TronKnotts @Emi1yRogers The Power Ranger/TMNT/YuGiOh/Pokemon youth audience is the audience you not only want for W101, but need.
@TronKnotts @Emi1yRogers They are out there and in large abundance. Surely, you must see this.
@TronKnotts @Emi1yRogers Don&#39;t you remember when Power Rangers/TMNT/YuGiOh/Pokemon WERE the new weird things? ;)
2DS is very interesting. Slate design appeals to those looking for that &quot;tablet&quot; experience, but brings with it the amazing 3DS/DS Lineup
Since GBA SP, Nintendo has made the clamshell design part of gaming culture. It protects your screen and goes away quietly. Why stray?
If you think 5-8 year old kids aren&#39;t already loving their 3DS/DSi - you&#39;re out of your mind. The Nintendo 2DS is weird.
The 2DS&#39; design screams &quot;always open&quot; - and parents love the ability to close their kids 3DS and say &quot;it&#39;s time for dinner/homework.&quot;
@TronKnotts @Emi1yRogers I agree 100% &amp; trust me - Not saying W101 is going to sell well - it&#39;s not. But I blame it&#39;s misguided marketing
On the bright side - Wii U is getting a price drop and Wind Waker HD is coming to digital download early.
For someone who was so behind, Nintendo really is doing digital right. Give the digital download gamers some incentive and they will come.
@TronKnotts @Emi1yRogers True that :-) Let&#39;s hope that it&#39;s at least as memorable as BeetleBorgs - over 15 years and you still remember it!
Make NO mistake - Nintendo feels the pressure from the growing tablet gaming marketplace. See: Wii U &amp; 2DS
@rikkipoynter Depends on where you&#39;re shipping.
@nadiaoxford @Nintendo_Okie If you don&#39;t think 5-8 year olds already love their 3DS or DSi then I think you&#39;re a little crazy.
@rikkipoynter You&#39;ll probably be paying the same amount - best go with flat rate. Flat Rate Box might be cheaper than envelope.
@nadiaoxford @Nintendo_Okie Indeed I did notice that, see my tweets :) agree with you but I think their attention should be elsewhere
@AndrewEisen A single screen Ninty Tablet is more likely than you think. Nintendo is obviously feeling the pressure from the tablet market.
@rikkipoynter success!!!
&quot;She was like &#39;Why do you have pictures of your penis on your phone?,&#39; well, what is art?&quot; | What?!? #OH #Overheard
@NE_austin What do you mean? It has a sleep switch.
@Xbox @cattaber Cat, are you in this?! Do you voice someone? Say.. April? :O!
@NE_austin Nintendo said explicitly that the 2DS is compatible with MOST DS games. How they handle it, we&#39;ll see - but they never said all.
@Cjaxs96 @NE_austin The IGN article said this is the case, but who knows!
Wow! Discovering that @cattaber plays April O&#39;Neil in the new TMNT game. Now she&#39;s voiced 2 of my favorite female characters.
What is this? It looks like it WANTS to be a Ninja Turtle but there&#39;s no way this is a Ninja Turtle... It&#39;s hideous!pic.twitter.com/RVOWGMdGLe

@kyle1point0 The designs are ATROCIOUS! Reviewing it for my site. Interesting gameplay, much deeper than I expected.

@TheBitBlock Same.
The Wii U in a nutshell. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuV8nSlRMhI&nbsp;…
@JoolsWatsham @The_Baconbitz So you think kids will WANT the 2DS? Even though they already have 3DS? Or their older siblings have 3DS?
@TheBitBlock @JoolsWatsham Impossible to comment on the build quality of 2DS without playing it. It looks well built and sturdy.
.@trace501 @johnpoz @benroethig @LisaMarieMary This makes me sad. Why kickstart an idea that&#39;s been around for years?http://www.zazzle.com/you_suck_at_parking_leave_under_wiper_blade_business_card-240973273195311579&nbsp;…

@camsicle Woo hoo! Thanks, it&#39;s a lot of fun :)
@JoolsWatsham Interesting stance you&#39;re taking against the platform when both Cut the Rope AND Mutant Mudds are available on both.
@JoolsWatsham Still, interesting. Can we expect a blog post soon? Would love to hear more of your thoughts. Or where this is coming from :)
@JoolsWatsham Yeah - I get that. Sorry about confusion - just seemed like you were saying one was a better &quot;starter&quot; exp. than the other.
@JoolsWatsham But I see now that&#39;s not the case. Still a worthwhile discussion.
@JoolsWatsham Yeah, it&#39;s pretty sad. Thinking about my childhood we had Mario, Sonic, etc. Now you see Angry Birds everywhere. So different

@TheBitBlock Correct, just like we&#39;re not allowed to punch him for what he did to Batman, Willy Wonka or Planet of the Apes.

People complaining about GTA 5, reviews for stupid reasons. It&#39;s really unsettling.
More concerned people claim to have experienced an entire sandbox game in a short amount of time w/ no access to a huge chunk (multiplayer)
Too many people hungry for that embargo release flood instead of giving people a fair review. So sad.

I am genuinely depressed by how broken GTA V Online is. I feel betrayed by @RockstarGames .
This is exactly why I think all those perfect scores GTA V got on launch week were BS. They only played half the game.
I can say that I&#39;ve put about 1-2 hours into GTA V Online and all of that was spent trying to start the required tutorial.
It hasn&#39;t let me play for a single minute. GTA V Online is BROKEN.
GTA V is the first game where I&#39;ve considered getting my money back 2 days after buying it. Thanks @RockstarGames

I did everything in my power - which means ignore him completely. He comes up to me finally and says &quot;I&#39;m leaving, just wanted to tell you.&quot;
So I was like &quot;Ok, thanks.&quot; and he&#39;s all shocked that I&#39;m okay with it. Really, Hippeaux?!
So he says &quot;Nevermind, I think we can be better friends. I&#39;m staying.&quot; DUDE! I HATE YOU! LEAVE! What kind of crap is that?! #ACNL

@TheBitBlock It&#39;s the story that keeps it so compelling. One of my all-time fav FPS. That nightclub scene - holy shit.
@PHIL_FISH Can&#39;t set number of frames but you can use Assistive Touch to set touch length
@PHIL_FISH I&#39;ll try to record a quick video demo of how to do that...
@PHIL_FISH Ok, uploading now. Hope it helps! Can also use this to do hands-free Vines....
@CoreySoup @PHIL_FISH Indeed! Can also use for handsfree Vines if you &quot;record&quot; a long press gesture. Here you go: http://youtu.be/SzckouaxRyE&nbsp;
@CoreySoup @PHIL_FISH And of course, I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re on an iPhone - if you&#39;re on Android then I&#39;m amazed you&#39;re using Vine :P!
Deus Ex: Human Revolution is 10 dollars on Steam. It&#39;s sales like this that make me wonder who would wait for the Wii U version? #sigh
@camsicle Haha! Poor guy, I think he had the wrong number ;)
