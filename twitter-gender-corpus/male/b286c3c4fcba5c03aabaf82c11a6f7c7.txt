Tired of people discrediting the Bible because of &quot;contradictions.&quot; Irony: we are all hypocrites who believe men who contradict themselves!
@gunslingerkenny Thanks, I needed that Ecc 7:14

That @axe commercial was the best. #nothingbeatsanastronaut
@LAMarquez Congratulations, I always knew that you were extremely intelligent. Top 3%, nice! Now go succeed. #doit #pushyourself
Pastor @scottyirka message really challenged me to be salty. I think many Christians feel defeated because they have lost their flavor.
Worship music great, but I want my heart and soul to sing out with my own unique song of praise to God. #inspiritandintruth #morethanasong
@Wade_Says I believe so. If you listen to only one album a month, which I&#39;m sure you do more, then you&#39;ve gotten your money&#39;s worth.
When God allows me to see just a glimpse of my depravity, I shutter at how lightly I esteem my salvation by grace through faith. #notworthy
@Wade_Says That&#39;s what I thought as well. It&#39;s interesting isn&#39;t it?
Prayer and worship are ment to change our heart and mind, not God&#39;s. God doesn&#39;t need our prayers or worship, but we need to pray and praise
@CharaJasmine CHARA! So, God&#39;s blessed you with a beautiful voice!
@CharaJasmine Really? Wow, Thank you! God is awesome, and I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.
@gunslingerkenny  the final video is being encoded! Yes! #GenerationCalling

Apparently there is a bomb threat in Jacksonville. All I know is that it took 15 minutes for 6 blocks.
The good news is that it was just a false alarm.
Lacking faith is not a problem of the head, but of the heart. #onlyJesus
Stop for a minute, remember Jesus overcame sin, temptation, and lies with his holy life. His victory is our victory and hope of glory!
Lets go #bulls! Win it!
#bulls won:)
Thank you Jesus dying for me because I need you always. #goodfriday
Christ died to pay the consequence of my sin and kill my old nature. He rose so that I could have a new, abundant life in him.  #JesusChrist
Our rights are God-given, not government sanctioned. The founding fathers understood this.
If we know Jesus, we know the truth that has set us free. Listen to Jesus, not the word of unrepented men who claim they can speak for God.
@therealskaylor I miss you Spence! 5ivecanons is not the same:/

@AaronJAlbright someone has a Bane complex...
@Wade_Says Yes! #seered :)
Lord set my desires on eternal goals and ambitions. Lead me to love you more and love selfishness less.
Just bought the self-titled album from #Emery front men @MattandTobyband  It&#39;s a rich blend of dynamic rhythms and lyrics - worship included
@gunslingerkenny I hope you are not talking about who I think you are:/
There is no secret to living a God honoring life. Just spend time with Him reading his words, and talking to him, and obeying (aka faith).
Boo! #Bulls trail in the series 1-2 :(
@Wade_Says I know, but if we won once, the we are capable of winning again. I just want to see Miami fans sweat, lol:)

My indecision amid prayer is diagnostic of a lack of faith, trust, and confidence. #faithwithoutactionisdead #unbelief I will seek council
Here I am praying for wisdom, when God softly tells me I should start praising him more. #humbled #content #moreofJesus
Christ died, rose again, and ascended so that we would know him and his Father the only true God, and believe the words of the Father.
Lord, teach me to be a selfless friend, one who serves others before myself without the barrier of judgement. #grace #love #mercy
@gunslingerkenny @Wade_Says  Lol, n00bs both of u, lololololol #L337speak

@Wade_Says Thank you Wade! I appreciate it:)
@gunslingerkenny @AlisPlath oh no... I forgot:p How about evangelism at the Jazz festival?
@gunslingerkenny @AlisPlath Bible study starts at 8! It&#39;s all good!

@theMCwale Photoshop can easily fix that :)
@willhobgood @AlisPlath I am lifting you both up in prayer. I ask the God&#39;s word is spoken through both of you. That Christ be proclaimed.
@Iamtheblizzard I&#39;m sorry about that:/
Okay, kicking off the Rise event! :)
Okay Lord, give me the grace to play life in #HARDMODE today. You are my strength, let me reflect your love. #ChristismyStrength
@JJStockdale Thursday was great, but service was cancelled because of the weather:/
@JJStockdale I will not be preaching next Thursday. I have been praying after our conversation and will call you later with my thoughts. :)

@JJStockdale I was in Panama for a week.
It&#39;s shameful how lax we&#39;ve become to immoral things. Should we find any pleasure in what God hates? We are new, made free from such bondage
Pray for brother in Christ of mine. His mother is in the hospital.
@Wade_Says I was also there yesterday!
@Wade_Says Exactly! We need to catch up some time!
@Wade_Says yeah, I was in Panama this past week so I couldn&#39;t answer your last text.

There is no place where we can hide from God&#39;s Spirit, Hallelujah! He is there to meet us, teach us and comfort us. #whatasaviour #greatGod
I think secular thought leads to self centeredness and to find a way. We are to love others and follow the way - We have the mind of Christ.
@theMCwale these tmobile updates are making laugh!

@michii_23 You went to Springfield? That sounds like fun! P.S. I hope you&#39;re not tweeting and driving! Well, we might be back in Jan &#39;14
@michii_23 It sounds like a great trip full with a whole lot of bonding:) I will be praying for safe travel home. God bless you both:)
@kellykinz97 I had to laugh at this:) I think you&#39;re being a bit harsh, lol. In my famous phrase, &quot;don&#39;t be a judging budgeted!&quot;
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will counsel you with My eye upon you. Psalm 32:8 #direction #trust
But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one&#39;s own interpretation, 2 Peter 1:20 and 21 is just as important.
My deepest desire is to promote and create a culture which centers on Jesus. Where music, art, fashion and pop culture would worship Him.
I feel there is a certain kind of pity or shame that prevents me from loving those less fortunate then I. Lord fill me with love and faith.
Is the #MathewsBridge closed today? Haha, this is a fun way to find out:) http://www.isthemathewsbridgeclosedtoday.com/&nbsp;
Most certainly a #YoungOceans kind of day. #chill #worship #rest #Jesus #work
@Mrmunguia it probably means there are some serious communication issues. After a while you might realize that lack of substance.
@Mrmunguia no Oscar, it doesn&#39;t always have to be selfish. Sometimes two people don&#39;t communicate or support one another in a healthy way.
@Mrmunguia some feel more supported by actions, gifts, etc. If two people can&#39;t show support there is no relationship even in attraction.

Fellow brothers and sisters of the faith, please pray for me this morning. Let&#39;s say i didn&#39;t wake up on the right side of the bed today.
I want to thank everyone who prayed for me this morning! There is nothing better than praying straight scripture and reading God&#39;s word!
Today, make it a goal share and show the Love of Jesus to someone! Remember #Faith #Hope #Love! Pray and read too! God bless in Jesus.
@gunslingerkenny Can you call me as soon as possible? It is important:)
@gunslingerkenny Twitter won&#39;t let me DM you! I will email you the details.
It&#39;s #Friday and I&#39;m ready to rock! I&#39;ve got way too many things to do:/

Because he lives I can face tomorrow. Because he lives all fear is gone. Because I know he holds the future and life is worth the living.
If you give up, only surrender to the Lord of all creation. Everything else will fall into place. #freedom
It&#39;s time to make changes. Radical changes.
Simply put: if your actions aren&#39;t enough and words are needed, it might be those actions are not truly there.
@phatboyvinny is the best!
O taste &amp; see the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusts in him. O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them fear him
@Cruz_Jamlec That&#39;s great news JC! Congratulations!
Looks interesting! I&#39;ll have to read Genesis before I go watch this. May it glorify the one true God.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRTlT3DEydU&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player&nbsp;…

Romans 13:14
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts. #saints #freedom #purity
Christianity is more than getting saved and keeping clean. It&#39;s loving God and loving people by helping, supporting and teaching each other.
R5:5 and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us
@Iamtheblizzard Thank you December! I hope you also have a wonderful Christmas! Will you visit your family?
