#Umbraco have a naming convention problem in scrapping 5 - will we see U++  or Umb2014 or 4.10 in a couple of years
@BoKDamgaard If #Umbraco 5 didn&#39;t perform then they should have withdrawn it (I agree) but unless Umbraco goes MVC soon it will die

Good to hear that Glen Chapple is staying at Lancs for another season http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/23879045&nbsp;… - 1,000 first class wickets must be the target

Two types of blog comment really make the commenter look like an idiot, which may not be the intention - so I&#39;ll help out ...
#1 Commenting on the headline (not the article) - you are taking the time to comment, it is usually worth the time to read the article first
#2 fact nitpicking - so what if there is the odd typo? If pro bono copywriting is for you, keep it to yourself - most people do&#39;nt care
