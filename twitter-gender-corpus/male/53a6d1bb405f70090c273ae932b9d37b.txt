scheduling a vet appointment for 3pm on a Sunday was a monumentally dumb idea
Can someone explain why Fox (or CBS) would opt to show paid programming instead of just showing football?
Is it because the local station doesn&#39;t want to pay for rights? Are they not allowed to broadcast even if they wanted to? I don&#39;t get it
@BooMan23 monumentally dumb. Thanks for the explanation.

@paulhogarth I reject this kind of critique. Shoots for an ideal that is impossible.
@paulhogarth maybe. the campaign you’re running needs to succeed and that’s a tactic. going for Organizing Utopia is the black hole to me.

oh boy more people read that than I thought
@JAMyerson hahahah no worries also did he do something tonight? Seems a lot of other chatter. I just said this randomly.
@JAMyerson yes 100% I was texting with @_ksl and decided to tweet it absent any context
In fairness I had a girlfriend and Ezra interrupted me talking to the girl I was pursuing to mention my girlfriend. STILL. COCKBLOCKER.
@Aubs one old fashioned does not make a public Ezra Klein concession. Twas two @_ksl texts.

@GrapeBelt damn straight!
thank you for your concern, people of the Internet. I am fine. I have Thai food, beer, a couch, and a damn fine Christmas tree.
@darth AND A DAMN FINE HAT INDEED DARTH. bless your kind, anonymous soul.
I am going to make sure to get a picture of @dirtmcgirt in front of this damn fine tree tonight.
@gfoneillalpha thank you! I have some but I&#39;m sticking with a heating pad right now.
@MikeSerpe I am not; this is a tree for my personal enjoyment
@GreenbergSez I&#39;ll be rich!
@mollykatch @dirtmcgirt ugh I am so tired and it took me an hour to position the damn thing in the stand so it wouldn&#39;t fall. Patience!!
@mcgregormt @kombiz you&#39;re welcome
@mollykatch ok ok decorating brb
@WashSqAssn yeah fuck working people!
@WashSqAssn this is a dumb argument when you&#39;re going to allow other vendors in, not on outskirts. And really stop rich people apology
Here is @dirtmcgirt and my damn fine Christmas tree.pic.twitter.com/pYqf5n1xiC
@mollykatch OK DONE
Ugh it&#39;s been two years and 4 moves since I last decorated a tree and I can&#39;t find half my ornaments
@Jessica_Effect @dirtmcgirt ecstatic. and definitely not just for the toy I dangled behind the camera

ugh just got followed by an account for a for-profit site that will put a @darth-like Santa hat on your picture.
@SantaOnPicture don&#39;t try to profit off of holiday joy. You are why we can&#39;t have nice things.
@kepsim did you at least sell the name to @Simplify
What is the name of the illustrated kid with the blonde hair and maybe a dog? French children&#39;s book? Not petit prince. The traveling one?
Maybe the kid goes to Algeria? It&#39;s like 1960s, I think french, pretty famous, not petit prince, and I&#39;m blanking
@melissagira YES THANK YOU. I was searching rin tin tin and was confused.
@PykeA @kepsim it took me like 20 minutes to remember this and it&#39;s no longer funny but kepsim sounds like a character from Tintin
@melissagira it&#39;s quite @rosadelauro-esque

THE INTERNET IS A DARK PLACE FULL OF TERRIBLE PEOPLE AND YOU WILL RUE THE DAY YOU STRUCK OUT THE LIGHT OF @DARTH
@PykeA not sure it was jokes — maybe from katie but i think others did want to dox
@PykeA google isn&#39;t helping with the last part of your tweet. Translate?
It&#39;s 7:42 and someone already needs to be thrown out of this bar
@chrislhayes @PykeA excellent, thanks chris.
@stefanjbecket I believe it is &quot;to dox&quot; that gets an extra X when it is acted upon, eg doxxed or doxxing
@bmaz darth locked account and deleted all tweets.
