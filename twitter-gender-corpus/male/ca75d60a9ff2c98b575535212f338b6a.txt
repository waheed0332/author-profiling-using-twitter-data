Just read the phrase &quot;viral rape videos&quot; in a news story and now I just want to turn the internet off and sit under a rock for a week.

Drove 9hrs by myself today, armed with 2yrs of Alec Baldwin &quot;Here&#39;s The Thing&quot; podcasts. Overall, a fantastic way to spend a Wednesday.
@themollycameron Yeah, that&#39;s the only way to take bikes on trips, flying with them sucks.
@holgate If you live in Oregon, it just shunts you to the Oregon subsite, which isn&#39;t even as good as the national one.
@themollycameron also nerd alert: I took a timelapse video of the entire trip. 6,300 images stitched into a 5min video. Uploading now.
@davidwogan The Jerry Seinfeld, Lena Dunham, and Judd Apatow episodes were fantastic too.
@sacca I actually looked for a Kindle version before I realized how stupid that would be.
@goldfine my favorites: Jerry Seinfeld, Lena Dunham, Judd Apatow, David Letterman, Kristen Wiig.

How did I miss this incredible talk by @anildash until now?  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=enzSENk51WM&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DenzSENk51WM&nbsp;… #passivelyrecreate #suitablyhopeless
@Coudal yeah kottke&#39;s was really good too. Anything else from webstock worth watching? I just saw those two talks so far.
@tomcoates I forgot I watched yours first Tom! It was good!
If I&#39;d worked at Twitter 4+yrs I&#39;d wear a sweater vest everyday and end any argument with &quot;I don&#39;t need this, I&#39;m fully vested!&quot; #TwitterIPO
@allaboutgeorge Thanks! I wrote that joke after reading your storify TWTR ipo roundup earlier.
Ask MeFi: Best way to buy Twitter stock on IPO day?http://mefi.us/a/251488&nbsp;
@schwa Thanks, I just set one for $30, let&#39;s see if it stays put or goes crazy in the morning.
@midnight do the @SklarBrothers play as one contestant or two?
@rebeccablood @artlung It has its own timeline, so you can see where all friends are. Broadcasting checkins to other services is annoying.
@rebeccablood @artlung and I mean annoying to people that follow you (I despise them on Twitter, unless there&#39;s a photo)
@rebeccablood @artlung Ah. Well I&#39;d say checkins mostly exist in the app itself, you can get alerts when friends are near, or venues hopping
@rebeccablood @artlung But you can also broadcast them out to other social networks.
@rebeccablood @artlung Yeah, that sounds accurate. (the announcing on other services is all optional)
@rebeccablood @artlung it always goes to your timeline in the app, that all friends can see (2-way friendships btw), send to tw/fb optional
@rebeccablood yeah here is my current 4sq feed (nearby tab was blank since I live in the boonies)pic.twitter.com/nBZyeJ5zjW
The @timehop app is great but I just got photos from 1day before my brain tumor diagnosis 4yrs ago. Later this week: my mom&#39;s death 2yrs ago
@drwave yeah the updates are the worst. I had no java on my Mac either.
Really enjoying the new Rich Twitter Investors of Instagram tumblr blog.
Whoa @chrismessina #thefutureisweirdpic.twitter.com/5gEggwSHtR
All the financial news channels go to commercial at the same time. That seems like a huge missed opportunity for all of them.
@plastikhu I&#39;m pretty sure they reused the same crowd shot over and over where I happened to not be laughing.
@ftrain A feature about JSON data fields reminds me of The Simpsons where &quot;Inanimate Carbon Rod&quot; became Time&#39;s person of the year.
@jwegener yeah it&#39;s still a great product, just that two gut punches in a week was a surprise.
Twitter&#39;s market cap could exceed Yahoo&#39;s by the end of the day. The same Yahoo whose $12 million offer for Twitter was declined in 2007.
@Cruftbox whoa, iOS 6 was bad for me (lost 60% per night) but 7 has been better, losing maybe 25% per night. Weird runaway app?
180 days from now is May 6, 2014. Shit&#39;s gonna get CRAAAAAZY in San Francisco after that day.
@schwa nope, priced out!  I&#39;ll buy some in 6mos.
The new Dart app is out! https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dart-share-links-privately/id701641900?mt=8&nbsp;… (it&#39;s kind of like a more private @potluck)
@migurski when employees can sell TWTR stock
@haroldcheck SERIOUSLY, I tried to tell my brother-in-law not to sell his house 4mo before Google&#39;s IPO. He could have gotten $300k more.
@daveg @megnut Dave, when you met me, I said &quot;gnarly&quot; at some point and you flipped out and said it was your new favorite word on earth.
@romanmars I hate you for making me feel guilty enough to use every revolving door I see now, even though it takes too long and I hate it.
@libbybrittain It&#39;s more private, you post links to specific people not a timeline, it&#39;s like potluck-meets-SMS. The onboarding needs work.
@tomcoates what did you spend your huge Facebook check on last year?
@anildash I was amazed how many people I knew in the acknowledgements! #humblebrag
Sitting in a car service waiting area, thinking I&#39;d spend almost any amount of money for a HBO GO account about now #HBOshutupandtakemymoney
@mfriesen you there for a newspaper conference? There&#39;s a pro cyclocross race there this weekend too.
Über for HBO GO subscriptions ($5 per hour while account owners are at work, not using the feature). #onlyhalfjoking
@nelson oh good call. Now I need to figure out how to go from usenet download, unpack, assemble to a remote Linux box all from my phone.
@dart The blank &quot;no darts, why not throw a few&quot; screen  could optionally show today&#39;s most shared darts (anonymously), no?
@GreeterDan naw my area has a fiber TV provider that doesn&#39;t support HBO GO. Sucks.
@jlax &amp; @gt I&#39;m in Toronto next week, can I pop by the office on Thursday &amp; say hi? Best time I wouldn&#39;t be in the way?
@migurski @anildash @nelson but also worst name, setup, UI ever. I gave it up and just use Unison now.
@migurski @anildash @nelson oh it works like a champ if you associate downloaded nzb files with it &amp; use giganews as the server.
@migurski I browse online directories, click a download, auto open in unison, then enjoy minutes later. No remote access via phone though.
@dart yeah the blank screen feels like a missed opportunity. A list of &quot;suggested darts&quot; culled from longreads or instapaper could work?
@mathowie In 2009, there were such awards. I think that 2009 might have been the salad year of Twitter. cc @shellen
@lonelysandwich Didn&#39;t you say joke workshopping was on the someday wishlist? You&#39;d share a draft with 3 friends privately for edits?
@dart ooh how about asking for my instapaper &amp; pinboard logins? Then suggested darts could be things I already saved for later personally.
iPhone&#39;s spellcheck is a 60 year old man I&#39;m always arguing with: &quot;&#39;wishlist&#39; &amp; &#39;instapaper&#39; are single words! Haven&#39;t you heard of them?!&quot;
@somebitsLinks @nelson I keep getting Space Invader or Georgia O&#39;Keefe paintings
Why doesn&#39;t @twitter support video in tweets natively?
I was terrified of the &quot;wheel o&#39; death&quot; thing until a 7 year old did it &amp; gave me tips https://www.icloud.com/photostream/#A3532ODWDSpu4&nbsp;… #thankskid

@Beschizza did you just subtweet me?
@waxpancake @Beschizza Yeah, just checking, because that&#39;d be super weird if it was coincidence. Also how in the world is Banksy still anon?
@brianellin How are custom timelines different than a twitter list timeline? They look similar to me, am I missing something?

Six years of using an iPhone and I&#39;ve seen a full crash/reboot maybe twice. Since iOS7 came out, it&#39;s been 3-4x per week. Both 5 &amp; 5s models
@torrez @_ I got hard crashes the first couple weeks of iOS7, now I get half crashes. Maybe faulty USB? (happens while connected to things)

@IFTTT Is there any way to fire a trigger when I tweet a word? All the RSS twitter search tools seem retired by their API.
@hondanhon dang, can I have it?
@hondanhon where was the preorder at? Amazon? Gamestop? Curious who is even taking orders these days.
@hondanhon Ah, they offer email alerts when they&#39;ll sell them again now. Suppose I&#39;ll try a brick and mortar store like Target or something
@IFTTT Naw, I want to make a swear jar app. If I tweet a f-bomb https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=fuck%20from%3Amathowie&nbsp;…, give a dollar to Kiva or something like that.
@IFTTT I could probably build a bot to RT my swearing or create a private API call via JSON or something. I wish it was easier though!
@device55 it&#39;s cool, bro *fist bumps*
@IFTTT Nice work, @maxmeyers! Slick workaround.
@torrez You have a home phone landline still?!
@duncan Was it more intense than Captain Phillips? That was kind of an insane tension-filled movie.

@jasonrobertshaw yeah I&#39;ve been meaning to do a post ten years update about what worked and didn&#39;t work.
Pacific Rim&#39;s Jaeger defenses growing weaker against Kaiju attacks is a pretty good metaphor for online advertising&#39;s decline due to mobile.
Also, if you check Adsense too often, your nose will bleed uncontrollably.

A quick recap of my trip last week to Toronto, and some of the sights I saw:https://mathowie.exposure.so/toronto-fall-2013&nbsp;…
@edcasey they don&#39;t do hugs, they&#39;re call bro-grabs.
@theory Yeah, the 5s is impressive. I didn&#39;t even take a &quot;real&quot; camera on the trip.
@AustinRamsland custom defeet company socks? http://instagram.com/p/g7SRj7JQgb/&nbsp; #awesome
If we enter a post-antibiotics age, prepare to be underwhelmed by the steroids that will be massively prescribed. Plus, awful side effects!
After 4 years of prescribed steroids, they&#39;re boring, help combat sickness, but no muscle/strength help plus tons of mid-section weight gain
@nathanperetic @buzz yeah but people associate them with sports and becoming superhuman. I&#39;m just saying prepare to be underwhelmed.
The new @twitter iOS app is pushing the limits of legibility. Tiny grey fonts make my old man eyes hurt.pic.twitter.com/eqJNYF9sPw
@waferbaby I like my devices at the defaults! It&#39;s weird when one app sticks out under default settings.
@keaggy blast! It was full when I did it. (One month longer is no big deal) I guess someone canceled in the last few minutes?
@chrishiggins whoa, you actually have some vintage 1980s NES hardware to play Tetris on?
@chrishiggins naw, dead serious! I knew you wrote about the Tetris champs, but wasn&#39;t sure how deep you got into it. Answer: fairly deep!
@girlhacker post a link when you do pick one!
Isn&#39;t it strange for Microsoft to buy wall-to-wall ads for the xbox one on every TV show when you can&#39;t easily buy one anytime soon?
@hondanhon Oh god, I wish iOS had the &lt;marquee&gt; tag just for that.
@dens every so often I get -1 interactions with the 4sq app (upper right). Maybe due to iOS notifications?pic.twitter.com/AU39nyh8N1
@dens @itsbonczek @krave @dolapo it&#39;s happens when I get a notification on my lock screen then open the app (I assume it takes 1 away then)
@grimmelm did they fix presenter view customizability yet?
Used Pinterest for the 1st time today and found photos of something I lost 6 years ago &amp; have been looking for online ever since. Amazing.
@nelson You&#39;d be anxious too if every other movie was about super earthquakes, sharks, and airplane crashes.
@joshdlondon a custom house site near where I live. I randomly found it one night and never again. It was the 2nd result in a city search
@joshdlondon Oh I tried. I scoured browser history, redid every search imaginable. I thought I imagined it. But tonight there it was.

@waxpancake I&#39;m with @dwineman this doesn&#39;t seen like a cut-and-dry parody at all. It&#39;s an ad for a product using a band&#39;s song.

@rustyk5 the dadjoke alarm went off, waking me up early here. Let me comb through the previous thread and then I&#39;ll peck out a few of my own
@davepell does this mean the podcast comes back?!
@davepell repeats from 1-2 years ago, edited shorter. He stopped new shows over the summer to prepare for MSNBC.
Another problem with the Goldiebox ad is that it&#39;s deceptive. The toy isn&#39;t for extravagant rube goldberg machines. My 7yo was bored by it.
I backed Goldiebox on Kickstarter, loved the story behind it, but they delivered a boring first product. The ad exaggerates what it does.
@bluedeerforest more complex puzzles? More options beyond ribbon and pulleys? Use of balls, boxes, string, height as well? Bigger board?
@eghenry Yeah, that&#39;s true, though the games doesn&#39;t offer the deep nerding-out that makers love (like Legos do). I wish the game did more.
@bluedeerforest yeah, they have the original on Amazon plus a parade float. http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=goldieblox&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=32541636991&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=5293966611114980169&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_1466msglkt_b&nbsp;…
@ginatrapani yeah, it is weird, but it makes the whole thing look like a marketing ploy when the core product doesn&#39;t live up to hype.
@ginatrapani Also, I&#39;m saying this separate from the fair use question (which I&#39;m iffy on it being parody). I backed GB hoping it&#39;d be great
@nzle was MOAR ASCII ART! the result you were looking for?
@GlennF Yeah, after reading @waxpancake&#39;s write up, i think GB will win in court. Other issues are side-issues.
@gabbyh @megnut No! This looks really cool and up my daughter&#39;s alley.
I&#39;m kind of surprised Apple hasn&#39;t figured out how to add new hardware purchases to Find My Phone so you can track the shipment to your door
@gabbyh @megnut everything after 8 has been relatively peaceful. I love traveling &amp; sightseeing with her now, it&#39;s fantastic.
@brainy oh right. Slight security downside for them. Didn&#39;t think of that.
@GrantBarrett &quot;because&quot; used in arguments: it&#39;s interesting because Internet. &quot;Hashtag&quot; is still popular. I wish &quot;adorbs&quot; would die, natch.
Getting kicked out of a survey in the middle of a line of questioning feels like losing in a choose your own adventure book.
@jonarogers apparently I watch the wrong TV shows, so I died on page 72.
@ryanchris with a big enough container, could you sous vide a whole turkey? What temp &amp; how long? Quick oven fire at end for brownness?
@ryanchris given how tricky sous vide cooking a simple egg is, I assumed whole turkey was way more complex. Thanks for the ruhlman article.

@caseyhop Yeah maybe? The only reason I&#39;d say so is that my iMac tilts forward when I&#39;m gone for the night. It&#39;s so tall it droops down.
@caseyhop but it doesn&#39;t feel as &quot;too tall&quot; as it did the first day. I lowered my geekdesk an inch or so and it was spot on.
@caseyhop It&#39;s really close to the correct height, maybe 1/2&quot; max shorter.

@BikeRanger nice! Glad to hear it helped. Have you gotten that book yet? It&#39;s seriously life changing.
@jkottke you meant to say &quot;You won&#39;t believe what one urban housewife just texted -- the contents will surprise dads everywhere&quot;

Just learned Rowdy Roddy Piper lives in Portland. Not gonna lie, I&#39;m stoked knowing I could run into him someday.
@jb it was the 1 year anniversary of Sandy Hook yesterday. It&#39;s incredibly poor taste to throw your gun show on that day.
@jb I don&#39;t mind guns (hunting rifles, target pistols), just seemed like organizers pulling a dick move to throw a show yesterday.

Pro tip: never select an Instagram filter while wearing polarized sunglasses.
Every sunny photo of someone wearing shorts on Dec 15th is a hate crime against Oregonians.

@fredbenenson it&#39;s always just neat eye candy, but an up/downstream social graph would show off influencers, first movers, etc.

@axoplasm D&#39;oh! I thought it was Sunday too until the day before it. I overslept and missed the early start and just ended up spectating.
@bryce interesting. Honest question: do you think the LDS will recognize same sex marriage in a future declaration in the next few years?
@bryce maybe there&#39;s a halfway where married same sex couples are preferable to unmarried without LDS having to say being gay is natural?
@fredbenenson @anildash Nice!

This holiday season&#39;s most under reported story is we somehow have LED xmas lights that are warm &amp; yellow instead of ugly bluish. SCIENCE!
@MaxTemkin Hallmark Channel?! What the what?! Max, did their social media person go rogue?

@holaMau both!
@drwave screenshot? That&#39;s a use of numbers I never imagined.

@sippey Thanks! I was going to warn you ahead of time but noticed you were traveling.
@sippey BTW, the rare @jkottke double-update http://kottke.org/13/12/this-is-what-its-like-to-be-poor&nbsp;… is the new EiiFiR. Story posted, then may be a hoax, then not so simple?

@jlax @waxpancake I wish this video played the first time you started up an iPhonehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA&nbsp;…
@jbenton Yeah, I think it&#39;s a word-wrap CSS bug from the right column&#39;s list of other Bits blog posts.
@waxpancake @jlax Or the YouTube Capture app could require horizontal orientation, throw a warning when you shoot portrait.
@JacobEthanWhite Yeah, you&#39;re right. BTW, I didn&#39;t know abt screenshot journal until now but was looking for this feature last week. Bought!
@anildash @fmanjoo @jlax @waxpancake Eyeballs are on our heads in a horizontal pattern. And I say that as a guy with one working eyeball.
@duncan @waxpancake @jlax I think ultimately it would encourage portrait video because it&#39;d seem &quot;larger&quot; on a desktop.
I had no idea portrait vs. landscape video was the new GIF pronunciation &amp; talking-in-theaters.
@scottsimpson I&#39;m always like DUDE THERE ARE 3 LEVELS OF CONTACT, email, text, then voice. YOU WENT TO DEFCON ONE MOTHERFUCKER!
@jlax an optic nerve.

@anildash @matthewbaldwin Ha! So utterly right as painful as it may be for me to admit. They&#39;re just tools that can be used any way we like.
@danbruno I think Vine and Instagram do square format video, so they take that out of the equation.

I feel like I&#39;ve already hit a ceiling in this world and will never get past it because I insisted on refusing to ever write in Markdown.
@adr No real objection other than it doesn&#39;t feel like it is faster or easier to write in. I still love @gruber &amp; I know lots swear by it.
@adr I&#39;m just surprised how many new writing tools are based off it, and almost require it.
@adr @gruber There feels like too much mental friction for me, like writing in Wiki CamelCaps style. I prefer straight HTML as dumb as it is
@grimmelm I just hate having to memorize another set of shortcuts, so I avoided it for the past decade. Now, every writing tool relies on it
@gruber @adr Honestly, I see these writer app demos with tons of # signs and weird characters and my brain just shuts off.

@waxpancake The only winning move is to not press play.

@tomcoates Every time I hear about the death of the Open Web I hear this:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ytCEuuW2_A&nbsp;…
@tomcoates The main problem was lack of social glue between blogs (it was there, just too weak). Centralized does it better, but kills open.
The most amazing part of Instagram Throwback Thursday is how in the hell totally non-technical users can easily pull up 1995 photos to post.
I&#39;ve worked as an internet professional for 16 years. The oldest photo I have on my Mac is 2003. It&#39;s a pain to get it copied to my phone.
@kragen They&#39;re trapped in iPhoto, getting one shot up to my iPhone requires tons of redoing how iPhoto interacts with my phone.
@gt It still boggles my mind that random people I know have a huge stash of 1990-era photos scanned somewhere. I&#39;ve never owned a scanner.

I just remarked to someone that a xmas singer on the radio &quot;sounded as good as Bing Crosby&quot; before finding out it was Michael Bublé. GAH!
@thelancearthur that was magnificent. Nice writing, @johnroderick!
@capndesign Yeah, I have to admit, the guy has some serious chops. I haven&#39;t heard that clear of a voice in ages.
@waxpancake @cabel Crap, I went to Target over the thanksgiving weekend for the first time in over a year. Will go check my account now.
@austinkleon what city is this one in?
@thelancearthur Jesus Jumped Up Christ. I never thought Utah would fall.
@sprockethouse Everyone I know kind of writes him off as nostalgic shlock, but the guy&#39;s got pipes and I really like him now.
@austinkleon Lucky! Awesome. I grew up with them and my only suggestion is replacing secret sauce with mustard, but I like mustard. A lot.

I don&#39;t know how they did it, but they pulled off the impossible: Anchorman 2 was pretty damn good.
@peterme It had a 82% on rotten tomatoes the last time I looked! That&#39;s pretty freaking solid for a comedy.

@waxpancake @fredbenenson Hey @davidfg that&#39;s why the floor was so bouncy!
@anildash $100 says she blames &quot;autocorrect fail&quot; 

Seriously, I bet it gets played off as a horrible innocent mistake.
@djacobs Feel free to just re-fave years-old Happy Birthday Matt tweets from here out.
@anildash Oh I agree, and all the Apple bloggers would point out the algorithms make it impossible, but &quot;autocorrect&quot; is the new &quot;hacked!&quot;
@gjcharlet yay! resolution! I was reading that this morning and starting to get a little concerned (of course, first thought it was you :)

My daughter &amp; her friends are testing the Santa idea, giving oddball requests to random mall Santas w/o telling parents to see it he&#39;s real.
@kathrynyu friend told Santa she wanted an octopus most. My daughter got her a stuffed animal one, friend didn&#39;t seem stoked for it.
@kathrynyu parents never heard about octopus wishes, so we think it was a Santa API test

@bryanboyer @benbrown don&#39;t get me started on markdown image references. You can still write HTML for the nutty markdown stuff.
@bryanboyer @benbrown does Ghost remove the little wysiwyg shortcut buttons? I&#39;ve never used it. 

I&#39;d say go with WP + supercache.
@benbrown @bryanboyer eh, it&#39;s fine for small sites with non-technical authors.
@tomcoates make Turkish Delight?
@rena_tom @bryanboyer @benbrown agreed. I have avoided markdown for a decade for the same reason.
@benbrown @rena_tom @bryanboyer that image tag tho http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img&nbsp;…
@20poundskull my secret weapon was finding out you can buy just one car from the fleet sales guy. They are usually nice &amp; non-aggressive.

The HVAC system just died so no heat until tomorrow. The Christmas miracles just keep on coming.
@gknauss KnaussNation implores you to reconsider.
I live in a town big enough to have 4 chinese restaurants, but not so big that it has enough non-xmas celebrators to keep one open today :(
My brother sent a video of my nephew freaking out, screaming I GOT A SURFACE!!! I should send it to Microsoft. He could be the new N64 kid.
@mrgan @antichrista Yeah, I bet Portland has like 20-30 Chinese restaurants, at least (probably some open). Not so in the sticks.
@mrzarquon Holy crap, that&#39;s kind of amazing.
Ok, this is too amazing not to share. This is my nephew going 100% legitamitely apeshit for his new Surface: http://instagram.com/p/iXdmTPxkVR/&nbsp;
The Grinch would have such a high Hacker News karma score.
Noticed many behaviors of the villains in Christmas movies/shows are similar to entrepreneurs that are getting funded by Y Combinator.

My house was w/o heat today because my Nest thermostat&#39;s internal battery died. Silicon Valley, always innovating new ways to ruin xmas.
@kmccoy it worked fine for two years. Somehow the plug got unseated until the battery died. Then the HVAC went dead on a cold day.
@kmccoy Ah, yeah, makes sense. For a sec I thought you were saying I wired mine wrong. After some charging it&#39;s working again.
@sufferfest Yeah, it&#39;s weird it gave off the wrong error code, but once I fixed one issue, the battery one started displaying an error.
@danlyke The lame part is it worked beautifully for two years, but then it&#39;s a total black box when things go wrong. It&#39;s working now though
@kmccoy @nest Not a bad idea. Just two buttons MAKE HOT / MAKE COLD and simple wiring behind.
@antichrista TWO kids in my Instagram stream got crossbows for xmas from their parents. Insane.
@KatieFnCompton Dude, you just beat the best all-around cyclist in the world. Twice. In the same week. Badass. Congrats on another win!
@megnut he&#39;s still plugging away. Probably another few days left.

@Jish @delfuego I use some Philips LED can light bulbs (B30 I think is the size?) and like them better than incandescent, esp in the kitchen
@MeganHoggins Inside of a blue police box, yes.
@joescales @Jish @nest yeah it threw out a disconnect error until I unplugged/replugged it, then low battery error. Could&#39;ve been smarter.

@megnut Yeah, FIP came back at the highest level. Fortunately, it&#39;s just respiratory, he&#39;s still eating, playing, but short of breath.
@messick A couple years ago I&#39;d spend half the day freaking out because we couldn&#39;t find a single brick in a pile of 2,500. Way easier now.

@gjcharlet Nice! Maybe Lion King is a better choice. Last summer&#39;s week with Fiona in SF was a blast (I wanted to go to NYC, she declined).
@_ Yeah it&#39;s odd, his family all have ios devices. I think it&#39;s his first own computer so he was super stoked.
@_ It was #1 on his santa list. The video goes another minute, he raises his hands in victory and says &quot;I was a good boy! thank you santa!&quot;
@danieleagee ask @ellyblue who does her small run zine printing?

@mulegirl She&#39;s the best, always funny and interesting on talk shows too. Honestly, I&#39;m amazed how wise she is at such a young age.
@jah Yeah, I&#39;ll try and film this soon. Are you editing all the video down to the best bits? (should I edit or just give you raw video?)
@torrez @tomcoates @jimray Well, the tax break for them was kind of weird, but I suppose SF makes it back in taxes on stocks.
@tomcoates @torrez @jimray The weirdest tax/city situation is the difference between Palo Alto schools and East Palo Alto schools.
@tomcoates @torrez @jimray Within a city barely a couple miles wide, you have stark differences due to money not being shared within.
@mulegirl @tomcoates Yeah, that&#39;s so weird for him to say. I took a BASIC programming class in 6th grade, over half of the class was female.
@mattcutts Whoa, that looks awesome. Does anyone sell this as a already done kit for those of us too lazy to solder our own?
@alainabrowne the secret ingredient is Comic Sans MS
@tomcoates @mulegirl It&#39;s problematic top to bottom, but he could certainly help, no matter how far down the chain his position is.
@tomcoates @mulegirl even though early STEM education sucks for young women,I take pride in knowing half of the employees I hired are female
@tomcoates @mulegirl I can&#39;t fix what happens to young women in 8th grade right now, but I can try and make it right today with my company.
@tomcoates @mulegirl Make it a priority when you get to hiring people. It&#39;s a bit extra work but pays off big with wider perspectives, etc.
@tomcoates @mulegirl he could say for 2015, YC will only fund companies with at least one female founder &amp; use the press to push early STEM?
@mulegirl @tomcoates the two times I hung out with Paul G, he seemed utterly lacking in empathy, borderline on the spectrum.
@skampy jeez. This reminds me that every social app shows @aaronsw as someone I should connect to, because he&#39;s first alphabetically

@codinghorror All I heard going into it was JLa, JLa, JLa, and she&#39;s good, but man, Amy Adams was crazy amazing good.
@drwave yeah that set the whole thing off kilter in a perfect way. I love stories that begin with weirdness.
@jeremyddunn everyone I know already saw it. I felt like the last person on earth that got to see it!
@codinghorror Whoa, that&#39;s a call-back I haven&#39;t thought about in ages.
@codinghorror Yeah I imagine they see way more than the average, think who else might end up in the ER late at night. The drunk &amp; stoned.

@gruber Cool. Medium-style layouts are kind of the norm now and your last big piece felt like it could benefit from that kind of layout.

@SOMAMadman @lukedones @brx0 @jessamyn @joshmillard @pbausch we probably should fold the 2 accounts into one.
The ASPCA achieves that rare result of me supporting their mission while at the same time being disgusted by their manipulative commercials.
I drove past this business and wondered if they go by the nickname Peezy.pic.twitter.com/yPKpj5mMDC

@kellan congrats!
@buster I use both the chromecast &amp; appletv. The chromecast doesn&#39;t quite do enough stuff on its own.
@donttrythis I&#39;m impressed by your restraint in NOT doing the classic joke &quot;what&#39;s the temp inside a tauntaun? lukewarm!&quot; in the SW special!
I&#39;m impressed when a goofy harmless place like an aquarium gift shop goes for the dark joke on a t-shirt.pic.twitter.com/DNXqxp7iJr
@dens I checked into a place far from home, 8min after a close friend did, but the 4sq app didn&#39;t alert us. Did we do something wrong?
@dens I have all the notifications &amp; nearby suggestions turned on. We never crossed paths &amp; didn&#39;t know til hours later we both were there.
@dens @4sqSupport I haven&#39;t before, but I saw the video for the new version which made it look like default behavior. I have to enable it?
@dens @gerstenzang @4sqSupport in this instance we were both like 60-90mi from home so it was an unusual checkin for both of us.
