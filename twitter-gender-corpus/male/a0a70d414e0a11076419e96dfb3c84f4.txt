Wow, Thiessen was quite the whiney bitch on #tds tonight. Can&#39;t wait to see the whole interview later on.
@ShirlEarp Yeah, that site just kind of died. No idea what happened to it or her.
Dear Apple. Mac Lion is a fucking piece of shit that makes me want to strangle something. But other than that, great job on everything!

Worst part of chemo today: listening to old people complain about weird stuff. &quot;Every country with dual languages is in the crapper!&quot;
I was recently asked &quot;how much is are good schools worth?&quot; I&#39;d say it&#39;s a bit too late to be asking that.
I got a fever and the only prescription is more cowbell! JK, it&#39;s large cocktails of poisons. I should go see that cowbell doctor though.
When making homemade salsa, I find a fresh, local, organic Uncle Saul is key. And yes, it will blend.

Spike TV&#39;s Alternate History should instead be called Shit We Pulled Out Of Our Asses.
While reading about 18th century GB, I came across one man&#39;s delicious title: earl of Sandwich. Almost made the first 494 pages worthwhile.
Though he called Americans &quot;raw, undisciplined, cowardly men.&quot; In other words, he was a douche undeserving of his title. So I claim it!
All emails not titled with &quot;Dear Goob: earl of Sandwich&quot; will go straight to the trashcan. You&#39;ve been warned.

Talking Dead: The talk show about ANOTHER show.
Coming soon: Stalking Dead. A show where cameras stalk the cast of Talking Dead discussing Walking Dead.
Talking Dead is a half hour show. That seems 30 minutes too long to me.
Crap, guys, I missed the last part of Talking Dead. Were they still chatting about Walking Dead or had the séance started?
Just realized that my crappy haircut is the perfect length for a mohawk. Week = Made.
Guy next to me on my flight is clipping his nails. How &quot;illegal&quot; is it to say I&#39;m an air marshal and threaten to pistol whip him?

&quot;Would you like delivery confirmation? Insurance? Overnight delivery? A PO Box? Maybe some stamps?&quot; &quot;No, I just want to send a damn letter!&quot;
For only $19, the USPS will record a video of them dropping off your package. An extra $2 lets you dictate where on the porch to leave it.
They also have a Warm Feeling option that guarantees the letter will be placed at the bottom of the stack of bills and spam. Only $25 extra!
For a mere $99, you can download a mail carriers route onto your GPS. It&#39;s the perfect way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.
@unsecretcrush I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t the only person to notice that.

Just realized there&#39;s a new @wnycradiolab podcast sitting in iTunes. Ohhhh buddy, I couldn&#39;t be happier right now. To the couch!
Just sent off one of the angriest e-mails (with bonus snark!) I&#39;ve written in a long time and it felt gooooooood.
Sorry to drag you out of bed, BriWi.
So the US has his body. Everybody place your bets on how many tattoos he has. I&#39;ve got $20 on a tramp stamp!
&quot;Grandpa, how did you learn Osama had been killed?&quot; &quot;Bobby Valentine told me.&quot;
Looks like all those hours spent training on the monkey bars didn&#39;t pay off.
Well, Matt Damon knows which movie he&#39;s filming next month.
Congrats to Abbottabad, Pakistan. Your Wikipedia page is about to get far more interesting!
Nothing like a possible snow day to turn everybody into Meteorologists.
@angelaf Be careful what you wish for - I&#39;m snowed in! And beer supplies are dangerously low!
@mathewsmom You are the first person to include me in a FF! As a prize, I award you twenty Awesome Points. Spend them wisely.
I dare anyone to watch drunk Ron Swanson dance and not smile. #ParksandRec
Caught my shirt on fire and forgot how to stop, drop, or roll. However, my run around and scream like a little girl skills are top notch.
I&#39;m a grown man and I still have trouble falling asleep on Christmas Eve.
@Copperllama Just to let ya know, the snuggie offer was a scam! =( http://bit.ly/7IfKR9
Okay @Tweetdeck, stop changing which account I&#39;m tweeting from while I&#39;m in the middle of typing my freaking update!
I strongly approve of this asshatery. Now I have some shopping to do. Turns out I&#39;m in the market for a megaphone. http://bit.ly/91udal
Taxes are due in 98 days! Wait, that means I still have 97 days to ignore them. Phew!
My new space heater works great as long as you don&#39;t mind strapping it directly to your chest.
I can&#39;t watch this enough http://bit.ly/4ZD8DD
@eclecticmess I didn&#39;t realize he had more! I&#39;d never heard of him before tonight, I can&#39;t wait to watch his other work. Much thanks.
Anyone who says &quot;failure is not an option&quot; has clearly never tried spreading sunscreen on their own back.
@angelaf Me too!
@zefrank Like an onomatopoeia?
While everyone is focused on the NBC debacle, it&#39;s a great time to admit &amp; bury bad news. Mom, Dad, I broke that vase in 1989. *Phew.*
Whoops. I just pulled a Weiner and tweeted to the wrong account. Luckily no pictures of my junk were involved.
Just realized I used the word &quot;phew&quot; twice in my past three tweets (now 3 in 4). I find that quite alarming.
Take away the GB-Ari game and this postseason has been abysmal. Somebody convince Marvin Harrison to unretire.
Standing in line at the grocery store. Can&#39;t help but look in peoples baskets and wonder what the hell they&#39;re about to cook.
I can&#39;t image how my life would have turned out if Chatroulette.com had existed when I was in high school.
Me: Screw 24, it&#39;s gotten stupid now. James: You know Katee Sackhoff&#39;s in it this year, right? Me: Aaaand, I&#39;ve got some downloading to do.
I can clean a gun &amp; build a computer,  yet opening a can of dinner rolls is apparently beyond my skills.
Half the people on my flight got sick during a turbulent landing. What a sneaky ploy by United to get us to buy another $7 boxed lunch.
I&#39;m not trendy enough to work at a coffee shop. That&#39;s why I convinced my local bar to open before noon.
I believe somebody de-listed me. I demand a Congressional investigation to never get to the bottom of it.
It&#39;s snowing. Again. Global warming sounds like a good idea right about now.
Damn you, Apple. Like I need another gadget in my life.
@IamRyanFitz Listen to @leesill and prepared to be amazed at the audio orgasm of Girl Talk!
My vet wants me to do daily reps of stretching with my dog. I didn&#39;t have the heart to tell him I don&#39;t exercise myself.
Now my truck won&#39;t start as I sit here in the post office parking lot. See, this is why I don&#39;t leave the house.
I think @NewlyParents will appreciate the irony that my truck broke after being pulled over for an expired vehicle inspection sticker.
@Shaynon I cannot wait. The next 24 hours are going to go so freaking slow!
There&#39;s an alarmingly high number of felines here at my CT scan. I&#39;m beginning to question my doctor&#39;s credentials.
Apparently I&#39;m the only person in the world who thought District 9 was absolutely atrocious.
Enough with Celebrity Doppelganger. I&#39;m currently friends with 4 Brad Pitts, 3 George Clooneys, and 19 Megan Foxes.
@nikostar I never could find one for myself. I like to imagine that means nobody is as good looking at me. Key word being imagine.
I&#39;ve had the idea to do something similar for eons, but there&#39;s no way I&#39;d have pulled it off as well as these guys did http://bit.ly/5tO8jQ
There&#39;s 3-4 feet of snow sitting in front of my driveway. Looks like I&#39;m not leaving my place for at least two months.
5 ft. of snow now at the end of my driveway (thanks VA DOT). It&#39;s only a matter of time before I go all Lord of the Flies on my dogs.
We&#39;re about to seriously test the craftsmanship of my back deck.
http://twitpic.com/11pui6 - My grill is somewhere under there. Looks like I&#39;m not having burgers tonight.
I FOUND THE YETI! Oh no, wait, I think that&#39;s a Christmas decoration we never put away.
Julianne went to have a snowball fight. She will be missed. The last thing I ever said to her was that she was a farthead.
I&#39;m conflicted. Do I invest money in a snow blower or copious amounts of liquor?
@nikostar It&#39;s still coming down too! Too bad I don&#39;t have a snowmobile.
I would trade a kidney for a snowmobile right about now. It&#39;s been too long since I&#39;ve played chicken with a tree at 70MPH.
driveway = shoveled. Also, either I&#39;m out of shape or baby aliens are primed to burst out of every muscle in my body.
Apparently only Bud, Doritos, and CBS are showing ads this year.
My fortune cookie actually said &quot;happy birthday.&quot; it got kind of weird when I added the &quot;in bed&quot; bit.
I&#39;m getting six to eight more inches! Oh wait…of snow =(
I can add nothing of value to this: http://bit.ly/clwFjD
Subject line from my inbox this morning: &quot;Yelp helps you score.&quot; Really? I must have overlooked that section.
Seriously, where are the St. Bernards with casks of bourbon when you need them?
I ran a series of successful websites and frequently got drunk. http://bit.ly/bHMFIG
The next person to say &quot;we got X inches of Global Warming&quot; gets an autographed punch in the face from yours truly.
Hey VA: Pass SB 660 &quot;Amazon Tax&quot; &amp; I&#39;m taking my business elsewhere. Surely another state would love to have me. http://bit.ly/dClcjx #sb660
This article has already come in handy since I first found it 24 hours ago. Bookmarked. http://bit.ly/a7Joth
Almost 4 years after I had the idea, Flattr.com comes around. About freaking time! http://bit.ly/aGJmpl From the founder of TPB no less.
With today&#39;s posting, I&#39;ve now made over two dozen tampon jokes on HIF. Mom, Dad, are you proud of me yet?!
Best part of working at home: watching the Olympics all day. Worst part: arguing w/ strangers on the Internet why Germany sucks at curling.
I&#39;ve resorted to peeing in the snow in order to melt it. I&#39;m confident I&#39;ll beat spring.
Just got on the plane withy brothers ticket. In other words, I&#39;m smooth.
I can now say I&#39;m related to the world&#39;s best #mw2 player!
I&#39;m a sucker for cool stop motion videos http://bit.ly/cVEqLd
Just got an e-mail containing the words &quot;synergy,&quot; &quot;web 2.0,&quot; and &quot;cloud,&quot; and &quot;blogosphere.&quot; I hope it enjoys the trash can.
I either dropped my phone or tried to eat it last night. Honestly not sure which.
I am now obsessed with trolling people on ChatRoulette. For the newbies out there, it&#39;s eventually NSFW, so only play at home.
Good luck to @okgo in topping their latest music video: http://bit.ly/9jC5dg
