I read the news today, oh boy.
About a pitcher who made the grade. And though the news was rather sad. Well, I just had to laugh.
But seriously, the Matt Harvey news is downright devastating. Even the most jaded #Mets fans are feeling the pain today.
@kschreebz You should play It&#39;s the End of the World As We Know It.
@kschreebz Woo, you rock! I&#39;m tuned in at the office.

@StephenGorchov I&#39;m trying a new Instagram rally technique for likes. The &quot;double tap&quot;
@StephenGorchov Thx! IG technique, usually used by celeb tribute accounts. I haven&#39;t seen a brand/Uni use it yet.
@PeteLabozetta The saxophone needs to make a comeback in theme music.
@StxV What KoRN song was on WRCN? Freak on a Leash? Blind?

Oh snap. #CatchingFire  #vip http://instagram.com/p/g9Q1uDHZMW/&nbsp;
@MGHeinz @StxV @Nagler My theory - Pres. Stanley convinced Jim Calhoun to take job. It fits him perfectly given all the uconn around him.
@MGHeinz @StxV @Nagler pikiell as head coach. His rocky relationship when Hathaway was UConn AD (now at Hofstra). And programs on upswing

I&#39;m shutting off the Jets and turning on the Seawolves.
I bet @ChampsRadioLI wishes they were broadcasting the #Seawolves game today.
@StephenGorchov The Knicks are clearly motivated from your viral tweet.

Don&#39;t despair, Knicks fans! We&#39;re still 3 games out of 1st in the Atlantic!

@AlexJamesFitz Funny, I was grumbling about that this morning during my commute!
The @NYRangers and Billy Joel are both MSG franchises, and both have not had a championship or hit-song in 20 years!
@StephenGorchov Must be tough for you knowing that Billy Joel is now an MSG team.
@StephenGorchov Soon - I hear they&#39;re going to air Hofstra Wrestling on MSG and boot the Knicks to MSG+2.
