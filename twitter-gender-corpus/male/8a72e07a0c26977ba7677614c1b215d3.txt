@mhawksey @datameer Should be possible. Make sure you have the right delimiter sign. Make sure you choose texts are in quotes.
@mhawksey I noticed your dataset has a few carriage return in the tweets. This will be corrcupted record since it is not valid csv.
@graemethickins try @datameer and you are a #datascientist in no time, as long you know how to use a spreadsheet. :)
.@mhawksey I downloaded the file and I&#39;m able to import it with 2.0.1. What version do you use. I&#39;m not using http though.
@mhawksey Let me try this too… give me a minute...
@mhawksey The problem might be https the forced redirectto https. :( Sorry. Any way you can make the data available with http?
@mhawksey yep I personal pushed it as critical into 2.0.3 (~4 weeks from now). cc @ejrosas can we give @mhawksey a custom plugin up front?
