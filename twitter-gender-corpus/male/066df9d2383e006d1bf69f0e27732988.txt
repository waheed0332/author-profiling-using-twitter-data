I’d have said, download Google+ for iPhone to upload your iOS Camera Roll to Google, for example. But hey, what do I know?
“The latest Mavericks requires the use of iCloud for Mac users if you want to transfer contacts”. Wrong! Also, “the latest Mavericks”?
Was there any other Mavericks prior to Mavericks that Apple users are unaware of?
“Disable iMessage, as that messenger is an iPhone-to-iPhone and if it’s on your iPhone friends texts won’t make it to Android”. Seriously?
Google chairman obv doesn’t know iMessage falls back to SMS. The stupider one is, the higher up the ladder one climbs. What a bozo!
@AppleNicholas it falls back to SMS so it doesn’t matter if I’m messaging iMessage-enabled contact or not
Thing is, shit Schmidt said disqualifies him as a chairman of anything. What did this guy ever invent that was so great?
@raywongy If I ever wanted to recommend an Android phone to iPhone switchers, it would be pure Android without any overlay nonsense
Go home, Eric Schmidt, you’re drunk
I think it’s high time Schmidt has gotten some adult supervision
“Your iPhone will still use SMS to reach your friends if you use the iPhone after this change.” Schmidt would never make a good writer.
@raywongy ya, lens are not that great. but the phone is pretty OK. Stock Android is recommended, OS updates get pushed immediately. My $0.02
“Make sure your iPhone is fully synced to iTunes. Your photos and music should all be backed up on your Mac when this is done.“ Er, no.
Weird, I never realized iTunes copies iPhone photos to my Mac. I must be a novice user…
“You will need to sign up for Google Wallet and give your credit card information, but it’s free.” It’s free (what is?), but you need my CC?
“It’s probably easiest to backup your iPhone photos to the Mac, but not copy the old photos to the Android phone.” What in the name of God??
“If the old photos are important, send them to Gmail and download into the Android phone” That’s some pro tip there!
Your whole post reads like a third grader wrote it, Eric! Please, educate yourself.
Perspective: Eric was on Apple’s board and supported Steve on stage at 2007 iPhone unveiling. With friends like these, who needs enemies?
3 letters @ Schmidt’s post: LOL
What baffles me is that many pro-Apple sites reblog Schmidt’s ‘switching to Android’ post with no critique whatsoeverhttp://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/24/google-chairman-eric-schmidt-posts-guide-on-converting-to-android-from-iphone/&nbsp;…
Point out ton of factually incorrect claims! Don’t just paste his post with some backgrounder, we know who Schmidt is. Godammit, I’m mad!

Big news: Apple buys social analytics company Topsy for $200 million http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/12/02/apple-buys-topsy/&nbsp;…
Topsy knows what you did on Twitter last summer so Apple could use it to augment Siri’s features
Another possibility: Topsy could help enhance iTunes Radio to alert you to trending songs
“Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time” boilerplate needs changing to “Apple frequently buys smaller tech companies”…
Interesting that Topsy’s How We Do It link is dead now http://about.topsy.com/company/press/topsy-releases-topsy-pro-analytics-worlds-most-powerful-social-analytics-tool/technology/overview&nbsp;…
The easiest thing to speculate: Apple is building its own social network/search engine
@flargh Google cache is your friend :D
The unpretentious, no-bullshit analysis of the significance of the Apple-Topsy deal is here… http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/12/02/apple-buys-topsy/&nbsp;…
One thing is certain: Tim Cook &amp; Co. now have massive amounts of useless Twitter data to work with.
@tapbot_paul You’re thinking about it in acqui-hire terms. $200M is what “the world’s only index of the public social web” is worth to AAPL.
First time I’ve heard of Topsy, BTW
So Topsy raised $32.2M in venture capital prior to the $200M Apple deal. That’s what I call a nice exit!
Seriously, what the hell is Tim Cook up to?
Plug Topsy into App Store search to improve relevancy and we can talk…
Topsy’s ‘Systems and methods for prediction-based crawling of social media network’ patent is interesting http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20130091087&nbsp;…

@markgurman @firecore About app not being live yet in any App Store, obviously
@markgurman @firecore I got the same notice. Is it live on the App Store? No.
Disclaimer: from now one, this dude is not honoring any embargoes. First is first!!!!!!
@alexeheath Alex, mind your own business and please don’t insert yourself in the discussion.
@MichaelSteeber @markgurman So why don’t fix your incorrect “FireCore releases Infuse 2” headline then?
I’m so glad I blocked this Steeber dude…

Introducing the Slope iPad stand by Dekke with unbelievable nanofoam micro-suction tech… http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/12/03/review-slope-by-dekke/&nbsp;…
BTW, the Slope is work of Chicago-based designer Erik Kittlaus. If his last name sounds familiar, that’s because it is!
See, Erik’s brother Dag co-founded search intelligence startup Siri that Apple bought to create its namesake digital assistant.
Creativity runs in the family!

Rumor also has it that Apple will refresh current iPads in April 2014, while releasing 4K iPad maxi in October 2014.
And, April 2014 iPad refresh could include Touch ID, a faster CPU (A7X or A8) and improved screen assembly, from what I heard.
@SonnyDickson True that!

@SonnyDickson Mark who? Michael who?

@AlfredWoodden @arnoldkim Not if used wisely…

Stupid Apple rumor says iPad Pro will have 2K screen and eye tracking http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/532526/20140102/apple-ipad-pro-release-date-feature.htm#.UsVfE3ktnbX&nbsp;…
First of all, eye tracking is a gimmick. Secondly, Retina iPad already has 2K screen.
Finally, I don’t think there’s such thing as 11.9-inch iPad Pro. My money is on a 12-inch Retain MacBook Air with 2K screen.
@Jim_Gresham Oh, I’m sure there are plenty more reasons to jailbreak than biteSMS alone
@NMosolei Stop fucking spamming me or else…
@Jim_Gresham Well, now that MobileSubstrate is 64-bit, let’s see new/existing tweaks optimized for iOS 7.
@Jim_Gresham What about themes and UI customization? That’s perhaps the top reason to jailbreak for the vast majority of jailbreakers, no?

@lkwolek You’re forgetting that Apple has yet to upgrade MBA to Retina
@dpacemaker Resistance is futile. Retina is 2K and I’m not even mentioning 4K. Clearness matters :D
@dpacemaker Than the 13-inch MBA will be your dream machine. I do all work on a 2011 13-inch MBA, hooked up to 27-inch Thunderbolt Display.

@lkwolek Not buying the iOS/OS X combo in a convertible laptop, doesn’t sound like Apple.
@lkwolek What I think they’ll do instead is an ARM-powered MBA running OS X, with 24+ hour battery life
@dpacemaker Great choice then. iMac as a family hub/media server, MBA as an ultra-portable thing, docked when needed to an external display
@lkwolek I think Retina on iPhones will stay at 326ppi, they’ll just up the resolution as the screen size changes.

@aamir__mir Yeah, especially in terms of platform-agnostic sharing
Now that Google is killing off Bump, a window of opportunity has just opened for that startup of yours, no?
@aamir__mir Other than Dropbox, no - at least not as comprehensive and cross-platform as Bump. You?
Hey Twitter, any Bump alternatives? Think cross-platform device-to-device sharing via P2P and mobile-to-desktop sharing via the web. Thanks!
