@julienisbet she&#39;s a cutie though
Is it normal for your hips to actually creek as you walk up the stairs?
Oops. Left my phone in the car this morning and only just noticed. Went back to retrieve it and poor thing had been ringing its head off
@adwatson1984 is this an Andy audit or a Craig audit ? #justwondering
Double workout today. 3 mile run at lunch time plus an hour circuit training. Blimey I&#39;m becoming one of &#39;them&#39;
No moon at all tonight. Nearly broke my neck walking the puppies around millennium green @sirhappyfeet
Walked into a bush FFS
@waynebarrigan @julienisbet I haven&#39;t but I always like a new challenge
@RuthStapleton which Boney M are we talking here?
@sirhappyfeet @RuthStapleton Boney M performed live at my graduation ball. Cool, I know
@RuthStapleton @sirhappyfeet well it was a good few years ago
@RuthStapleton I know Ruth. @sirhappyfeet doesn&#39;t appreciate good music that&#39;s all
Hey @sirhappyfeet leading your daughter astraypic.twitter.com/IV3yUIipel
I need @babynisbet to help me play blackjack mire often. I started with £10 only 15 mins ago. Tripled itpic.twitter.com/vAGbXyRt6A
I think she wants me to play 5 boxes not 3 @babynisbetpic.twitter.com/dkFLPWLsHd
@sirhappyfeet she won me £20 what a clever girl. She knows basic strategy now
Stupidly busy at work meaning my fitbit step count is in the red most days. Need more lunchtime runs I think. Or to take my desk out
@sirhappyfeet have a cute baby in tow may get us upgraded to 1st class but also may make us look a bit gay!
@davey_mc we can all have one
Pretty impressed with my new now TV which arrived this morning
@sirhappyfeet @TASHA_BAYNHAM @stevieguitar40 Christ don&#39;t ask me. @Nikkidee2000 is chief bin putter outer
@leanham44 you can get @ahradio on it
I hate chuggers and I particularly hate telephone chuggers. Poor Indian bloke just got it for phoning me. I asked for their charity no too
Today I must have a &#39;please stop me&#39; sign on. Tramps, chuggers and lost pedestrians all asking for stuff today
@passy73 I gave the tramp 2p - I did feel sorry for him
@edjames we had that in France. The accordion player made us all lol at the stereotypical French man with a striped top and accordion
Tonight I learned that there are about 10,000 satellite channels on a motorised system and that friggin JML sells shit in 500 languages
Ahh the first of the month. The day where most of the money drains from my bank account in one fell swoop.
Managed to get through the night without being called out which is positive.
@The_Robbo those two would need more than 1 bottle though, crazy psycho bleach ladies
@The_Robbo aye they were. TV love mixing extremes though, dirty mingers vs OCD cleaners being a prime example
@RuthStapleton pension as early as you can. I joined mine at 22. Retirement seems a long way off but it compounds so much
Bought my poppy today. Have you got yours yet??
@RuthStapleton there are tax advantages too, get them to cost it up because it can cost very little and your employer has to put £££ in
Can&#39;t believe how big @The_Robbo &#39;s dog has grown to in a matter of weeks. Are they feeding it weetabix or sommat ?
Frost! I didn&#39;t expect that on my car window
Hahaha. Loved the start of @johnkendal3 show. Thought I was watching corrie
@julienisbet you got the lurgy ?
Hey @The_Robbo do you fancy this? http://www.runnation.co.uk/run-northumberland-half-marathon-2014-99-p.asp&nbsp;…
@The_Robbo yeah that’s the one. I quite enjoyed that one, until the last couple of miles with those stupid hills. But hills are healthy
@FionaAlton we are still in the same queue
What an absolute shambles. Archers Ice Cream parlour firework display. Terrible organisation. 90% of people leaving before fireworks. Boooo
If it wasn&#39;t a charity event I&#39;d be asking for a refund
@FionaAlton we gave up at 7:45. The kids were crying, it was cold and there was no info so we just called it a (disappointing) night
@GNairambulance I hope you managed to raise a decent amount of cash from the charity bonfire, but it was a shambles from our point of view.
@leanham44 and you love it
Sat at work, but have got @ahradio on and John Morgan is playing some good tunes today.
@adwatson1984 I&#39;ve left now, I came in at 8. The others came in a bit later and are still around
Very true , I nicked it from Facebookpic.twitter.com/yjU7gAMGHw
@julienisbet apparently rubbing Vicks on your feet and leaving a sock on helps. Worked last time I tried it. No idea how or why
Really successful night at @SpiceLounge11  - raised over £800 I almost left without paying the bill. Yikes that would have made me popular !
@armsta01 @SpiceLounge11 only 1 point in it. Very good effort indeed. Might revisit the sports round next time
Pretty tired this morning after a late night at the @ahradio event. 4 hours of &#39;Great Line Management&#39;. I will try to be enthusiastic
Giving the fireworks at Hardwick Hall a try out. 100% than archers already and it was only £5. The rides will cost!pic.twitter.com/pcTxBK7ChK
Hardwick Hall pulled it off very wells. 30 minutes of fireworks, only cost £5 for all of us. Kids loved itpic.twitter.com/AUy9Caeb6P

Great service from @British_Airways today. Couldn&#39;t have been more helpful. Pleased to be jetting off to Vegas in January with them
@British_Airways we will do thanks. It&#39;s a 30th birthday Vegas special for @sirhappyfeet first long haul with BA. So far very good
My French class has moved onto the subject of food. A fantastic topic. I want to try a Paris-Brest. Need to get to France I think
This is a Paris-Brest by the waypic.twitter.com/wgIBb7Jkn9

I think the only way to start the day is with a large costa. Then we&#39;ll go from there
Had my day brightened up by a man who looks like Emmett Brown belly laughing loudly while reading his paper. I&#39;ll have what he&#39;s drinking!

Faux pas of the day. I accidentally told my boss I&#39;m Leaving. I meant to write, I&#39;ve put some leave in
Doing a disco for 40 under 8s. All asking for bleedin one direction or someone
@gazza_d @KarlOnSea @amsterdamized @marksuttonbike no no no. People shouldn&#39;t be controlled by permit, it has to be a choice. Not northkorea
@gazza_d @KarlOnSea you need a permit at work so they can skim off £20 a month from your salary. They don&#39;t care about our parking really.
Good all. Another work day today. Lots to do. I bought chocolate bars to keep the troops going. Only at Darlo unfortunately.

Spent a fortune on Xmas shopping today. I think the most valuable purchase was this £1 tape dispenserpic.twitter.com/Rvij5tsOhy
Well, I liked the Marks and Sparks roast beef in red wine gravy. Would get use to this kind of grub. Maybe need a lottery win to keep it up
@waynebarrigan Watching it too
Awww the little girl at the Festival of Remembrance. She got it word perfect.
@The_Robbo @julienisbet OH CHRIST. Why would you do that? I’ve never watched it again, for very good reason.
I wonder if they’ll end with the National Anthem? I love a bit of God Save The Queen
@The_Leechy @julienisbet OH the shame
HERE WE GO. #GodSaveTheQueen
I liked the way the entire audience at the Albert Hall all turned to the face the Queen as the sang the national anthem. That looked nice.
@julienisbet wrapping Xmas presents. Observing a silence at 11am and going for lunch chez @pigglyugg and @pigglyuggswife then to @ahradio
@richardosman did you find it funny that @julienisbet thought The Princess of Wales was called Diana Andrews ?
Well, my breakfast isn&#39;t gonna make itself. I suppose I&#39;d better get up, or shout down for @Nikkidee2000 to get the bacon butties on
@davembe name and shame them Dave
@davembe there&#39;s no excuse for that.
Her Majesty did a Stirling job once again this morning
@leanham44 I had missed it and now opened that just as I was tucking into my Sunday lunch
The downside of doing the show on my own is I had to run up 2 flights and stairs to the ward with a prize before the song finishes @ahradio
HA, if abba do reunite you&#39;ll all be agreeing with me. I said on national telly that I love abba and I will be proved right very soon
Good morning tweets. Today will be interesting if nothing else
@johnkendal3 we have a major new system going live today
Well it&#39;s been an interesting half day that&#39;s for sure
Prostitutes in rio learning English ahead if World Cup? Surely sucky sucky, me love you long time doesn&#39;t take much learning.
@gazza_d and if you borrowed that on an unauthorised overdraft it would be a fortune more than that.
@David_Cameron correct, however It&#39;s not right that we send money to a country with a space programme.
Bloody charity telephone chuggers! I wish they’d sod off. I don’t give money to anyone over the phone
£8 a month these charities are asking for. No way.
You can text DEC to 70000 to donate £5 to those poor people in the Philippines
Well I&#39;m off to bed. Goodnight all.
Good morning tweets
@gazza_d yes but by the same argument drivers aren&#39;t deliberately diving into cyclists either.
@waynebarrigan and I&#39;ve volunteered my wife to knock up a Paris-Brest
@afneil I don&#39;t give a frack either way

After an initial shock I am now rolling my sleeves up for a pretty impressive comeback @adwatson1984 is gonna have to be the voice of reason

@julienisbet find the real job centre twitter account then give them hell
My scales are broken. This is gonna affect my OCD weighing routine. I wonder if salter can fix them.
@LindsayMc21 you doing anything in particular?
3rd weekend at work in a row. Actually, quite like Saturdays. Get loads done.
Very productive morning in a bizarre kind of way.
I need to start taking cash to costco. Every time I go I end up spending a fortune. Got some crackin deals though I suppose
@gazza_d these kind of cases are so sad because it could be the driver or the cyclist in the wrong. One is dead the other life ruined.
@gazza_d no one will ever really know what happened. That&#39;s the problem.
@julienisbet yes she got an award from the queen you know. Don&#39;t you think MI5 had her checked out before inviting her to the palace?
The global warming lobby have jumped on the Philippines storm as being down to climate change when there is no evidence at all.
@adwatson1984 this morning I have also encountered a load of pricks. Maybe it&#39;s drive like a wanker day and no one told us
I bought 3 packs of rocky bar today. For the price of 1. Living the dream here folks. Rocky anyone?
@RuthStapleton I won’t lie to you, I do go in there, but I am a bit of a supermarket whore. I only go where the offers attract me
I just bloody sneezed and pulled a muscle. Owww
@RuthStapleton Remember - eye level is buy level. Always look down for the offers

A stone off since my holidays which is pretty good, but my wedding ring is now hanging off my finger. I want it off my stomach not fingers!
@leanham44 can I just add that @Nikkidee2000 did the cooking, my job was simply to reheat said meal.
@leanham44 the grunter thinks sky is free

@TASHA_BAYNHAM ah maybe it was the one I dropped ;-)

I think the energy companies have suddenly realised that they&#39;re in danger of becoming the new bankers if they&#39;re not careful. Unpopular.
Dear @David_Cameron my energy bill recently went up by £20 per month. Your £12 per year doesn&#39;t even touch the sides I&#39;m afraid. Try harder

@ITVLauraK I&#39;d like to hear about it all on the day, from the chancellor, in parliament and not all leaked in advance. It&#39;s not acceptable
@BBCBusiness who told you that? The government haven&#39;t been leaking again have they?
@theanthonydavis no need to be excited, looks like @George_Osborne has leaked most of it early as usual
Have to say, the autumn statement sounds pretty good so far. Not bad, of course we had already heard most if it in advance

@julienisbet I like this head chef at the @ploughpub and he shouldn&#39;t have been fired I reckon.
@leanham44 from the photos it looked like you enjoyed it
@The_Robbo @sirhappyfeet oh
@julienisbet what when I come to walk the dogs??
I see Eastenders hasn&#39;t changed. Caught 15 mins of it and virtually every scene has had a blazing argument. Off to slit my wrists now
Oh now it looks like poor old dot is about to be raped and murdered, or at least robbed.
@gazza_d are you going to the DMH Xmas lunch on Wednesday ?
@gazza_d oh I&#39;d forgotten about that. Due to cuts we may have to repeat last years
@gazza_d or perhaps run it in 10 minute delay so we can add an audience in
And these jokers want more money? Surely they should be arrested for fraud http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bbo3wAyCAAAnieo.jpg#twimg&nbsp;…
Probably best I log out, I&#39;ve been in one if those real grouchy moods all night and it&#39;s not conducive to happy tweets.
So, if I clocked in for 20 mins, then went home would I still get paid, or more likely I&#39;d get fired!

@David_Cameron it makes it easier for the scrounges too unfortunately
@Nikkidee2000 now now dear, I didn&#39;t expect such lightning service that&#39;s all. Lucky it wasn&#39;t full of £££ like normal or I&#39;d be crying

Look @David_Cameron If you stick me in the lords, I’ll claim the £300 every day, but I’ll go there every day and stay all day. Please sort.
@David_Cameron I quite like the sound of Lord Robinson. I can be effective and I reckon the lords needs more people from the street.
@adwatson1984 just remember, nobody ever said on their deathbed that they wished they&#39;d spent more time at work.

The highlight of the broadcasting year will indeed be at 2pm when we take the studio to a packed carol service for some festive spirit.
@gazza_d oh, due to licence restrictions and the fact the streaming server shouldn&#39;t be overloaded we have had to restrict the audience ;-)

Off to the docs to get this noisy hip looked at. I hope they don&#39;t recommend I be put down
@edjames I&#39;ll suggest that to the doc
Our surgery is in the 21st century. Online appointments. Let&#39;s see if this works or if they have no idea I&#39;m coming
Time keeping clearly isn&#39;t one of the strengths of this surgery. How can they be so late so early in the morning?
@TheNobler if I can ever get in I&#39;ll find out!
I&#39;m not impressed so far. 25 mins after my appointment and someone else just got beeped into the doc I&#39;m meant to be seeing.
And the NHS wonder why people show up at A&amp;E. If the GP service is as crap as this I&#39;m not surprised at all. I&#39;m off shortly, will go to A&amp;E
@adwatson1984 any movement?
@adwatson1984 should I phone and ask the ward to hold off till 24th? There is some hope for the sweepstake yet :-)

Spent 3 hours wrapping presents tonight. A lot of cash doesn&#39;t wrap down into much. Not a lot to look at.
@leanham44  sure it will stitch
Still can&#39;t get my head round the @TheAtoZofPop show. Santa&#39;s sackful or something. Tongue twister that&#39;s what it is. It&#39;s on @ahradio
@The_Robbo how do you come to that conclusion? This was your idea
@The_Robbo @ambigfoot I was thinking the same
@The_Robbo @ambigfoot changed I&#39;m sure
Metro centre isn&#39;t as bad as I thought. All presents now bought, no more is to be spent. On the plus side, the Hilton gold status continues
Due to the spending levels&#39;
I have to admit, doing xmas shopping with @The_Robbo is like going with a bloke, straight in, item picked, straight out. All my stuff got!
@The_Robbo I thought they liked my banter
@KTHopkins @marksandspencer or just make it free and continue with the other items. Simple? Then everyone is happy
Arrrggghhh 4% battery life and no charger
@davey_mc I&#39;ve got one. I done have enough of the daft power leads to carry about.
@leanham44 if there&#39;s too many for me just whack them in a gift bag ;-)
I see the south is gonna get a bit of wind and rain l. Oh, wait, we&#39;ve had that all week and it didn&#39;t make the national news. Softies
Apparently my hip problem wasn&#39;t a hip problem, it was my knee grinding. I have patellofermoral syndrome. (Runner&#39;s Knee) would you believe!
@davey_mc is it busy or have you got off lightly ?
Got my new blackberry z10 - not a bad device
Sometimes you have a lucky escape, it&#39;s only later when you realise how lucky it was.

@Jim01081 I&#39;ve contacted simon to find out what&#39;s happened.
@Jim01081 Simon could only find part 1. Where was part 2? It&#39;s coming on at 5
@Jim01081 problem solved and your show will be ok the air from 5pm. For some reason your second hour was saved in a folder called &#39;singles&#39;
I bought a few people a lottery ticket for tonight as a little quirky Christmas stocking filler. I wish them all luck. I didn&#39;t get 1 for me
Pleased to see Her Majesty on top form again today. Just got a chance to watch her speech on the iplayer.

Yumm this M&amp;S food stuff is really nice. Pity I can&#39;t afford to do my weekly shop there.
Don&#39;t believe it. Kids out for the night and here I am wide awake at 6am. Could have at least managed 7:30 surely!
The New Years honours list is huge, most of the people on it are ordinary folks doing great things. The ones you&#39;ll hear about are famous.
@gazza_d you weren&#39;t on the list
There must have been some admin error. I&#39;ve been missed off the Honours list again.
Happy New Year to all those in New Zealand
@ThreeUK  I think you have 3G problems in Darlington town centre. Recently there seems to be 3G but no data. Only in town centre area

Why are @Barclays the most unhelpful bank in the world ever? Business accounts with multiple signatories is an absolute nightmare to  sort!
I think the staff at @Barclays have a competition for how many bleedin forms they can get you to fill in for the same request.
@DurhamCouncil any reason why your parking ticket machines don&#39;t give change? It&#39;s robbery
I&#39;m not having a very good day so far

@johnkendal3 I wrote it on a pad and lost he bit of paper somewhere!
@BarclaysOnline change of main address. All forms filled in. Then more forms to update details of existing signatories with info you have
@BarclaysOnline go into branch and they haven&#39;t got a clue because they are retail only, pass be onto a number to phone. Simple request
My day gets worse. @Morrisons left me standing at self service checkout. Please wait, the assistant is coming. No one came! I left the stuff
Then the Jeweller in @Morrisons had a sign up saying he opens at 10:15, but he often doesn&#39;t turn up at all. Another wasted trip. FFS
I&#39;m going back to bed. The world is full of incompetent fools and idiots this morning. Is it me ? Groan
Anyway I&#39;m gonna stop moaning and chill out. I&#39;m off to Vegas so all these little niggles can go and do one. Nice cup of tea now I think
@BarclaysOnline I phoned up the team who sorted it out for me. I don&#39;t know why the Branch staff don&#39;t know this stuff too. Thats my point.

Free chocolate baileys pre flight.... Why not
I&#39;m now on the plane, which means for the next 10 hours you&#39;ll enjoy some peace and quiet. Unless they upgrade us and turn on the wifi.
@johnkendal3 we can spark up a debate with the fellow passengers
Oh bollocks. The plane has broken down and we have to get off while they fix it. Bugger
@johnkendal3 it requires a part which is not readily available. Oh joy. Back into the terminal we go. But we are seeing the funny side
@sirhappyfeet let&#39;s hope @britishairways get the plane fixed soon enough
Only on the Las Vegas flight can the passengers run a book on the bloody outcome of our delay
They have fixed the plane and we are back on board. The bad news is on the process of de boarding I&#39;ve lost my @fitbit #gutted
Ready to fly when all the other passengers get out of the PUB!pic.twitter.com/ZclIQpDBz7
I asked the woman what was wrong with the plane, she said it was a hose reel. I said was it important, she said she didn&#39;t know. Erm ok

Where are all the fruit machines in the airport??
Well, that&#39;s me adjusted to USA time. Good morning folks. I&#39;m up and ready to take on Vegas. Lets hope the tables are feeling generous

I feel physically unable to move after a giant slab of cheesecake. Hoist at table 9 please waiter.....
Natural cheese flavour apparentlypic.twitter.com/KYM6hhNX4S
@julienisbet unfortunately we didn&#39;t budget for food, so we are on cheesy puffs today. #gamblersanonymous
@LindsayMc21 well these are nice enough for 98c a bag
I can&#39;t believe the first hand I played at $10 a hand and I got blackjack. Pure luck of course but a good omen I feel
Well it&#39;s a good morning from Sunny Las Vegas. I will try to eat a better diet than cheesy puffs, cheesecake and burgers. #heffer
@Remediosjkpw go fuck yourself
No sign of my fitbit in Heathrow Lost Property. Reading through the list I can&#39;t believe the things people misplace.
On a plus note, it&#39;s 11 degrees above normal here in Las Vegas, according to our weatherman
@johnkendal3 yeah I lost my @FitbitUK while getting on and off the broken airplane the other day
@johnkendal3 yeah but the excess is £50 it&#39;s not worth it
Went to @luxorLV for breakfast. Forgot how annoying it is to be approach by timeshare people. Heading back out again. Bye Bye
A winning session on the blackjack and @sirhappyfeet has hot footed us down to the apple store to buy an iPad air.
@LindsayMc21 we don&#39;t plan on buying much else so it doesn&#39;t matter so much. Plus it was way off the limit after we fluttered our eyelashes
@armsta01 @LindsayMc21 well they probably won&#39;t but we are within limits anyway so it&#39;s not a big deal to them
@armsta01 @LindsayMc21 we have discussed what would happen if we won a million dollars. We need to work out how to export it
@RuthStapleton I fall into this category.
Off to Hoover Dam today. It is a miracle of engineering

I turn my back for 1 minute and @sirhappyfeet goes onto $10 blackjack. He won $60pic.twitter.com/OLREAiDHio
@davey_mc it paid out $23
Oh Christ. Not only did @sirhappyfeet tip a latte into the check in computer, he poured a bottle of bud into the auto shuffler on the BJ
Bought our show tickets courtesy of El Cortez casino Las Vegas. Aka our amazing blackjack skills
@davey_mc we booked zumanity and blue man group

@gazza_d I saw one cyclist in Vegas. Albeit  at night with no lights on. They don&#39;t seem to have the cycling bug here. Lots of cycle lanes.

Let the blackjack commence!!
Can&#39;t get used to American radio. They say fuckin all the time. It&#39;s 2:38pm for crying out loud
@sirhappyfeet and a very good deed it was too
@davey_mc we go past it every day but there is a massive queue outside
Had a good time playing blackjack again today. Overall we lost today but we were having so much fun it didn&#39;t matter. Off to pawn stars now
@davey_mc we went today but there was such a stupid queue outside we didn&#39;t bother going in. When we head downtown tomorrow will look
Having a balanced tea. Onion rings, flipz and chocolate donut holes. That qualifies right?
Today is the last full day in Vegas. I&#39;ve ordered temperatures of 21degrees and a flurry if winning hands in blackjack. Followed by a steak.
The steak house has come highly recommended and we had to reserve a table so let&#39;s hope it&#39;s as good as the last time we were here.
If I move to Vegas I could just live off the earnings of blackjackpic.twitter.com/rmrBT9YYTa
I said to @sirhappyfeet what should we do with all this money we&#39;ve won. He suggested giving to some homeless guy. Sod that, let&#39;s spend it

BA have over booked our flight and wanted us to stay another 24 hours and be paid for the hassle. I asked for 1st class instead... We wait
Las Vegas airport has free high speed wifi and charging stations everywhere. Come on UK airports this is where you&#39;re missing a trick

@waynebarrigan @julienisbet I haven&#39;t but I always like a new challenge
@RuthStapleton which Boney M are we talking here?
@sirhappyfeet @RuthStapleton Boney M performed live at my graduation ball. Cool, I know
@RuthStapleton @sirhappyfeet well it was a good few years ago

@davey_mc we can all have one
Pretty impressed with my new now TV which arrived this morning

Tonight I learned that there are about 10,000 satellite channels on a motorised system and that friggin JML sells shit in 500 languages
Ahh the first of the month. The day where most of the money drains from my bank account in one fell swoop.
Managed to get through the night without being called out which is positive.
@The_Robbo those two would need more than 1 bottle though, crazy psycho bleach ladies
@The_Robbo aye they were. TV love mixing extremes though, dirty mingers vs OCD cleaners being a prime example
@RuthStapleton pension as early as you can. I joined mine at 22. Retirement seems a long way off but it compounds so much
Bought my poppy today. Have you got yours yet??
@RuthStapleton there are tax advantages too, get them to cost it up because it can cost very little and your employer has to put £££ in
Can&#39;t believe how big @The_Robbo &#39;s dog has grown to in a matter of weeks. Are they feeding it weetabix or sommat ?
Frost! I didn&#39;t expect that on my car window

@FionaAlton we are still in the same queue
What an absolute shambles. Archers Ice Cream parlour firework display. Terrible organisation. 90% of people leaving before fireworks. Boooo
If it wasn&#39;t a charity event I&#39;d be asking for a refund
@FionaAlton we gave up at 7:45. The kids were crying, it was cold and there was no info so we just called it a (disappointing) night
@GNairambulance I hope you managed to raise a decent amount of cash from the charity bonfire, but it was a shambles from our point of view.
@leanham44 and you love it
Sat at work, but have got @ahradio on and John Morgan is playing some good tunes today.

Really successful night at @SpiceLounge11  - raised over £800 I almost left without paying the bill. Yikes that would have made me popular !
@armsta01 @SpiceLounge11 only 1 point in it. Very good effort indeed. Might revisit the sports round next time
Pretty tired this morning after a late night at the @ahradio event. 4 hours of &#39;Great Line Management&#39;. I will try to be enthusiastic

Great service from @British_Airways today. Couldn&#39;t have been more helpful. Pleased to be jetting off to Vegas in January with them

@gazza_d @KarlOnSea you need a permit at work so they can skim off £20 a month from your salary. They don&#39;t care about our parking really.

@waynebarrigan Watching it too
Awww the little girl at the Festival of Remembrance. She got it word perfect.
@The_Robbo @julienisbet OH CHRIST. Why would you do that? I’ve never watched it again, for very good reason.
I wonder if they’ll end with the National Anthem? I love a bit of God Save The Queen
@The_Leechy @julienisbet OH the shame
HERE WE GO. #GodSaveTheQueen
I liked the way the entire audience at the Albert Hall all turned to the face the Queen as the sang the national anthem. That looked nice.

Her Majesty did a Stirling job once again this morning

Prostitutes in rio learning English ahead if World Cup? Surely sucky sucky, me love you long time doesn&#39;t take much learning.
@gazza_d and if you borrowed that on an unauthorised overdraft it would be a fortune more than that.
@David_Cameron correct, however It&#39;s not right that we send money to a country with a space programme.
Bloody charity telephone chuggers! I wish they’d sod off. I don’t give money to anyone over the phone
£8 a month these charities are asking for. No way.

@LindsayMc21 you doing anything in particular?
3rd weekend at work in a row. Actually, quite like Saturdays. Get loads done.
Very productive morning in a bizarre kind of way.
I need to start taking cash to costco. Every time I go I end up spending a fortune. Got some crackin deals though I suppose
@gazza_d these kind of cases are so sad because it could be the driver or the cyclist in the wrong. One is dead the other life ruined.
@gazza_d no one will ever really know what happened. That&#39;s the problem.
@julienisbet yes she got an award from the queen you know. Don&#39;t you think MI5 had her checked out before inviting her to the palace?
The global warming lobby have jumped on the Philippines storm as being down to climate change when there is no evidence at all.
@adwatson1984 this morning I have also encountered a load of pricks. Maybe it&#39;s drive like a wanker day and no one told us
I bought 3 packs of rocky bar today. For the price of 1. Living the dream here folks. Rocky anyone?

@ITVLauraK I&#39;d like to hear about it all on the day, from the chancellor, in parliament and not all leaked in advance. It&#39;s not acceptable
@BBCBusiness who told you that? The government haven&#39;t been leaking again have they?
@theanthonydavis no need to be excited, looks like @George_Osborne has leaked most of it early as usual
Have to say, the autumn statement sounds pretty good so far. Not bad, of course we had already heard most if it in advance
Looks like the river tyne is overflowing into places it shouldn&#39;t
@davey_mc perhaps send a mop for the river tyne which is over it&#39;s banks
@gazza_d how would you describe the NHS pay freeze ? Not a subsidy to someone  I would suggest
@gazza_d but it was a theoretical tax anyway, it never happened so you can&#39;t hypothesise what you could have done with it
@Jim01081 I don&#39;t do TV, except pointless of course
@davey_mc so what does giraffe taste like? Chicken I bet
Xmas tree and boxes galore out of the loft. It&#39;s gonna take half a day tomorrow to get the house festive. Hope @johnkendal3 has Xmas songs
Good Food HD is showing Nigella Christmas again. Yeah, sweet potato soup and mince pies this episode.
Blimey, the post office are keen. Delivering parcels for Christmas at 7:20am on a Saturday. Lucky I was up
Telling the kids in advance the Christmas tree is going up this morning ensured a 6am wake up call to put it uppic.twitter.com/Ha776kXVL1
@LindsayMc21 and @davey_mc may end up stranded in the states. Problems with air traffic control. Far too risky to travel
@johnmyersteam walking around it isn&#39;t the problem, walking through it is
@davey_mc it&#39;s been top news here all day
Kids watching the polar express. I find it an awful, creepy film. Don&#39;t like it at all
Hey @julienisbet I was making some French pastry and found your dogs liked to like the bowl, hope that&#39;s ok :-)pic.twitter.com/pg4jrDAtfM
I do end up agreeing to the most bizarre stuff. Recording a band in ebbchester or somewhere
Hey @Nikkidee2000 @TopInventionss is now on twitter
Looks like @LindsayMc21 and @davey_mc will get home after all. Problems all fixed
@The_Robbo is this one you&#39;re fighting on principle or do you have a chance of winning it?
@The_Robbo I am sure you will be able to present a robust and adequate defense in court
@gazza_d no no, our pay review body said 1% and the bastards are trying to wriggle out of that too whilst lining their own pockets. Shocking
Just caught the latest episode of The Tunnel. Now it&#39;s getting really good. Lots of twists and turns
My morning took an unexpected turn when I rescued a stray dog with the help of @julienisbet / she is in safe hands now
In the process of louring the dog into the house I managed to give it a pound of @Nikkidee2000 &#39;s premium ham. Gotta go to shop how. Oops.
Aww I hope the little doggy I handed into stray aid was ok. Poor thing was all alone.
@George_Osborne @Morrisons did they let you take it home?
I wonder if I can pass off a Gregg&#39;s cream bun as a Paris-Brest? I need to get this right and I only have 1 opportunity tonight to make it
@julienisbet you&#39;ll be fine. Just go in and knock em dead. Not literally though
@davey_mc yes but I&#39;m not paying those prices. My surname isn&#39;t McElhone moneybags
@leanham44 I recommend Las Vegas
@leanham44 then Vegas is in the dessert!
Lure, that&#39;s how you spell lure!
3rd attempt at the Paris-Brest and I&#39;m pretty damn impressed with it. The French class had better be begging for more or I&#39;ll be upset

@gazza_d what I wanna know is, where do I get my membership card? That place looks really cheap
It&#39;s always good exercise when @tigerquaker borrows your car. He parks it a mile away from the hospital

One Paris-Brest complete. I hope it tastes good and the Frenchies like itpic.twitter.com/K6y6Umri6j
Authentic French meal they said. However we deviated slightly by the fact we had 4 courses of dessert on top of the previous courses #full
Genius marketing. http://youtu.be/zIEIvi2MuEk&nbsp; - I love this airline and I&#39;d never heard of them before now

@UgotMoed ????
Looking at that signer from the Mandela memorial, I could have done a better job
@sirhappyfeet I want to get our dollars where they get theirs from
Picking up @LindsayMc21 and @davey_mc from the airport. I feel like I need a big sign like all the other collectors
I can I just look out for the forklift truck bringing their luggage out
Big bunch of young students outside of college in darlo, puffing away. How do kids of today even think it&#39;s good to start smoking?
@ThreeUK do you have problems with data at the moment? Good signal in Darlington very poor 3G. Keeps dropping
Looks like upload is working on @ThreeUK but not download
@ThreeUKSupport I am in the DL3 6HX area
@gazza_d he might have got away with it in asda
Some folks don&#39;t age well. Just a general observation
Just read about the three feel at home service. Basically I can use my mobile as if I am at home whilst in Vegas, no extra cost. Fantastic!
@The_Robbo but he is so cute
I&#39;ve just realised, I haven&#39;t had a Christmas card from @David_Cameron this year. #justsaying
@adwatson1984 could have been worse. Could have been 7pm finish. #justsaying
@davey_mc according to three the only thing you need to setup is to turn off euro pass and you&#39;re in business
I wish you goodnight tweets. Having an early one.
@armsta01 people who updated their PC and it installed itself
@gazza_d which one
How come Egypt get the snow and we don&#39;t get it? What&#39;s going on with the weather? Come on its Christmas
@ambigfoot I share that view
Well, that’s @Nikkidee2000 accounts done for another year. Just need to pass to the accountant to vet. I hate doing accounts by the way
@johnprescott maybe a trainee?
@johnkendal3 I&#39;m sure the vicar was trying to get his own back on all the folks who don&#39;t believe in God, which is equally as weird as Santa
My hip has developed an alarming creaking noise when I walk up stairs. Googling this only causes more worry as to what it could be
@RuthStapleton nice to see the @ahradio one at the top
Our Christmas cards have been done by @nisbetphotos this year. Looking pretty impressive. Will post pic when I&#39;ve sent my cards to people
@johnkendal3 No, but it makes an awful creaking noise. It is quite disturbing. I think I&#39;m gonna have to go to the docs with this one
@johnkendal3 no it&#39;s being doing it a while
@niwise blister plasters work well on nipples and are easy to remove afterwards
@niwise the blister plasters just melt off even the hairiest of folks
@sirhappyfeet I never had @The_Robbo down as a poundland lass
@AdamWray2 the author of the framework perhaps
@The_Robbo you can buy it in kg tubs in France. I&#39;ll get some for you
I wonder if the head chef had access to their twitter account hahapic.twitter.com/RtK4CZ2o76
@julienisbet I like this head chef at the @ploughpub and he shouldn&#39;t have been fired I reckon.
@leanham44 from the photos it looked like you enjoyed it
@The_Robbo @sirhappyfeet oh
@julienisbet what when I come to walk the dogs??
I see Eastenders hasn&#39;t changed. Caught 15 mins of it and virtually every scene has had a blazing argument. Off to slit my wrists now
Oh now it looks like poor old dot is about to be raped and murdered, or at least robbed.
@gazza_d are you going to the DMH Xmas lunch on Wednesday ?
@gazza_d oh I&#39;d forgotten about that. Due to cuts we may have to repeat last years
@gazza_d or perhaps run it in 10 minute delay so we can add an audience in
And these jokers want more money? Surely they should be arrested for fraud http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bbo3wAyCAAAnieo.jpg#twimg&nbsp;…
Probably best I log out, I&#39;ve been in one if those real grouchy moods all night and it&#39;s not conducive to happy tweets.
So, if I clocked in for 20 mins, then went home would I still get paid, or more likely I&#39;d get fired!

I have lost my voice. This will please many people I know
Talk about money laundering! @Nikkidee2000 put my wallet through a full wash cycle.
I&#39;m baby sitting @MillieNisbet @CharlieNisbet and @babynisbet tonight. I bet I get wrong for taking this outpic.twitter.com/yr5bygQKfq
@David_Cameron it makes it easier for the scrounges too unfortunately
@Nikkidee2000 now now dear, I didn&#39;t expect such lightning service that&#39;s all. Lucky it wasn&#39;t full of £££ like normal or I&#39;d be crying
@gazza_d get yourself joined in man, it&#39;s Christmas
I love the whole @ploughpub story and fact the guy @chefjimknight  managed to get a new job on the back of it. Well done that lad.
How do people spoof cli when spamming me??pic.twitter.com/jB0b21epEP
Look @David_Cameron If you stick me in the lords, I’ll claim the £300 every day, but I’ll go there every day and stay all day. Please sort.
@David_Cameron I quite like the sound of Lord Robinson. I can be effective and I reckon the lords needs more people from the street.
@adwatson1984 just remember, nobody ever said on their deathbed that they wished they&#39;d spent more time at work.
Yeah yeah, it was just self raising flour you fools -http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25415095&nbsp;…

What&#39;s all the fuss about a thief who dies years later? Why the celebrity status anyway? Move on @SkyNews
@LindsayMc21 I&#39;ll be watching it later
The pier in St. Kilda, Australia where the woman fell offwas right near where me and @Nikkidee2000 stayed on our honeymoon.
@LindsayMc21 we will have done too. It was horrendous for about 2 or 3 minutes. So bad it set off several car alarms in our street

Today I will be mostly doing @ahradio  work with @SimonTemby (he doesn&#39;t tweet). Oh and some last minute Xmas shopping online.
The highlight of the broadcasting year will indeed be at 2pm when we take the studio to a packed carol service for some festive spirit.
@gazza_d oh, due to licence restrictions and the fact the streaming server shouldn&#39;t be overloaded we have had to restrict the audience ;-)
@ChriswMP problem is, you lot aren&#39;t offering any realistic credible alternative
Today&#39;s stats: I&#39;ve spent 46 minutes on Twitter, according to the SocialClock app. See how much you have: http://goo.gl/pxO8Ve&nbsp;
I will be making a personal appearance at Sainsbury&#39;s in Bishop Auckland today, bag packing for @ahradio - please don&#39;t mob me
Off to the docs to get this noisy hip looked at. I hope they don&#39;t recommend I be put down
@edjames I&#39;ll suggest that to the doc
Our surgery is in the 21st century. Online appointments. Let&#39;s see if this works or if they have no idea I&#39;m coming
Time keeping clearly isn&#39;t one of the strengths of this surgery. How can they be so late so early in the morning?
@TheNobler if I can ever get in I&#39;ll find out!
I&#39;m not impressed so far. 25 mins after my appointment and someone else just got beeped into the doc I&#39;m meant to be seeing.
And the NHS wonder why people show up at A&amp;E. If the GP service is as crap as this I&#39;m not surprised at all. I&#39;m off shortly, will go to A&amp;E
@adwatson1984 any movement?
@adwatson1984 should I phone and ask the ward to hold off till 24th? There is some hope for the sweepstake yet :-)

@leanham44 I&#39;m full of lurgy too. Typical when I&#39;m off work
Spent 3 hours wrapping presents tonight. A lot of cash doesn&#39;t wrap down into much. Not a lot to look at.
@leanham44  sure it will stitch
Still can&#39;t get my head round the @TheAtoZofPop show. Santa&#39;s sackful or something. Tongue twister that&#39;s what it is. It&#39;s on @ahradio
@The_Robbo how do you come to that conclusion? This was your idea
