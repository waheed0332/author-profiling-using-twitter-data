@IllinLaneCraig Butt sex, as U call it, spreads disease, + not just among men who have sex w/ men, but the women who have sex with these men

@IllinLaneCraig So R U saying tht b/c sneezing + coughing spread disease, we shouldn&#39;t do anything abt perverse behav&#39;s that spread disease?
@IllinLaneCraig ...Or are U saying that homosexual sodomy + various other perversions are as common and unthreatening as the everyday cold?
@IllinLaneCraig Examples: rectal sex, rimming, lesbian sex, #lesbians using sex toys to mimic both &quot;gay&quot; + hetero sex, fisting: #perversions
@IllinLaneCraig How can U ignore the #CDC data that connects homosexual activity disproportionately to various sex diseases? #hiv #tcot #p2

@IllinLaneCraig U havent answered my ? abt the implications of homosexuality being linked disproportionately to disease. Why? Do U see any?
@IllinLaneCraig We&#39;ll never agree on morality of anal sex; however perhaps we can agree on the data that it&#39;s more dangerous than normal sex
@IllinLaneCraig ...with my caveat (which surely you will challenge) that for homosexuals there is no such thing as *normal sex.* #tcot
@IllinLaneCraig @skennedy8975 U are behind the times: the professionals use the term &quot;safer sex.&quot; Safer than what? (+ it&#39;s failed miserably)
@IllinLaneCraig well that&#39;s a Clinton-esque tweet! Pt. Is : some behaviors like anal sex are very high risk + should be discouraged. #tcot
@IllinLaneCraig Butt sex, as U call it, is agnst Nature (+ Nature&#39;s God, which U reject). No surprise then that its a high-risk behav. #tcot
@IllinLaneCraig besides, given its link to disease, I think more appropriate question is why would U argue that &quot;butt sex&quot; is moral? #tcot
@IllinLaneCraig In other words the burden of proof is on U to make a case for anal sex, both as a practical + moral issue. Good luck w/ that
@phildutra @IllinLaneCraig no I&#39;m just saying tht bad, high-risk behaviors  should be discouraged by society. &amp; U need to find a new putdown

@ImYourDM @the_author_ @APBBlue good for you: the reality is there are a lot of left-wing haters + LW reactionaries. Deal with it.
@antipyrine Tht penalty is draconian + not enforced, as U know. But history shows repealing sodomy laws opens up floodgates of homo&#39;l actvsm

@AliciaHendley @Darinstrauss &amp; U of all people know that homosexuality was removed by APA as a mental disorder after a *gay* pressure blitz.
My pastor hit the nail on the head: the problem w/ &quot;gays&quot; is they &quot;think they&#39;re not sinning.&quot; Homo&#39;l practice is a sin acc. to God&#39;s Word.

@AliciaHendley @Darinstrauss You&#39;re writing a politically correct history: the APA psychiatrists were pressured by homosex&#39;l activst bullies
@AliciaHendley @Darinstrauss The pt. is APA&#39;s removal of homo&#39;lity as a mental disorder was a *political,* not scientific, decision. #tcot
@AliciaHendley @Darinstrauss R U  claiming that the intense pressure campaigns orchestrated by gay activists had no effect on the &quot;science&quot;?

@AliciaHendley @Darinstrauss except tht (transgendersm doesnt count),  theres no such thing as an ex-female while there R many EX-homosex&#39;ls

@scott_hurst and needless to say the same standard would apply to men who lust after men only they add another sin on top of an existing sin
@scott_hurst @krelnik well I think atheism is silly + preposterous, but the point about Jesus and his higher sexual purity standard remains
@scott_hurst says who? Didn&#39;t liberal theologians/historians used to think David&#39;s reign was mythical until archaeology proved otherwise?
@scott_hurst and yet Jesus didn&#39;t kill the adulteress...
@scott_hurst based on what? I suppose you would say the same of me, but you certainly possess a strong self-interest bias as an atheist
@scott_hurst I don&#39;t know ur knowledge base. I do suspect you&#39;re overstating the academic case. I recall studying the academic claims of &quot;Q&quot;
@scott_hurst fair enough.  Happy New Year
@scott_hurst ps, U&#39;re certainly correct on hypocrisy of many conserv. Chr&#39;ns in not applying Jesus&#39; teachings on sex&#39;l purity (+ divorce)...
@scott_hurst however, they are trumped by the secular/relig. Left who ridiculously claim that Jesus would support homosexuality. #tcot #p2
@scott_hurst I dispute ur description of hurting others: how many 100s of thousands of men have died from diseases linked to homosexual sex?
@scott_hurst I think it wld help reduce respect for real marriage, eg, gay men in *monogamous* relat&#39;shps R notorious 4 allow&#39;g outside sex
@scott_hurst hear you speak out of ignorance: have U looked at the CDC data: 94-95% of HIV cases in males ages 13-24 limited to homo&#39;l sex
@scott_hurst now I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re that reckless in your historical research....
@scott_hurst ok, doesn&#39;t it affect my children when they are taught in public schools that homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; is real marriage? #tcot
@scott_hurst point is in every other area of life high-risk behaviors are discouraged--not promoted as it w/ (male) homosexuality. #tcot #p2
@scott_hurst now you&#39;re entering that realm of philosophy and theology. Your faithless: how can U believe that all this came from nothing?!
@scott_hurst do you have children?
@scott_hurst U don&#39;t know the Truth, Scott. we have diff. ideas abt what constitutes truth. U (pridefully?) feel U&#39;ve negated my view of it.
@scott_hurst but evidently that&#39;s not the case if U look at the CDC data: some types of promiscuity are clearly  more dangerous than others
@scott_hurst if U only knew the secular and gay hate that I&#39;m exposed to on a regular basis U might rethink that statement. gotta run...

@PeterTatchell Didn&#39;t U write a book with an advocate of pedophilia, Peter? You should not be allowed near schools w/ that credential #tcot
@FuckCaitlinDick @Furr @JoeMyGod so what? Lots of aberrant behav&#39;s have existed throughout history; tht doesn&#39;t mean we celebrate them.#tcot
@PeterTatchell so what is your excuse for working with a man who advocated for pedophilia (sex b/t men + boys), or are my facts wrong? #tcot
@davidzenker I haven&#39;t even started season 1 yet. But insofar as &quot;Glee&quot; glamorizes sexual perversion to young ppl, its a bad influence #tcot
@erinfuller37 no sweat, Erin. You&#39;re decent enough to apologize.  God bless.
