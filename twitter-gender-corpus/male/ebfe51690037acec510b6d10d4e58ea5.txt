@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck How bout a tweet campaign to quell his anger
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck If we can harness the power of social to send him happy thoughts, we can put him in the right frame of mind.
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjvUX1CEdL4&nbsp;… Or should that be oyster for the duck?
As @Seal has ears, surely he should be called Sealion. @SnoopLion you&#39;ve made a leonine transition. Can you offer any advice?
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck Well, we need a &#39;Bob - Anger chart&#39; for starters....
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck ...Followed by a real time app to sync positive tweets with his reduction in temper...
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck ...And an objective - i.e. if he reaches his target in x days, then y will employ him...
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck ...This would all need to be housed on a web page, enabling supporters to literally see his anger go down - or indeed up
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck Of course there will be &#39;haters&#39; who won&#39;t want Bob to get a job, so we need to work against this.
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck Bob will need to vet tweets in real time and respond to both good and bad. In doing this we&#39;re raising his profile...
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck ...And increasing his chances of employment with our cause...so whatcha think?
@BOC_ATM @BobMcDuck Give me someone who can build and design the web page/anger chart and I can handle the rest...

New TV show idea. People stand before a panel of judges and do absolutely nothing. Their friends and relatives cry backstage.
Or a music contest where performers experience what they&#39;re singing about in real time, to ensure authenticity.

Or a show where members of the public compete to win the coveted title of &#39;Britain&#39;s Leading Amateur Proctologist&#39;
Or a show where the star prize is a swim in a lake.

Mike&#39;s felt his pants quickly fill with icy Lemon Fanta. But curious hands told a different story #badnovelopenings

It all began with the white cat and his blood stained fur. Tony never really liked goats but melons drove him wild #badnovelopenings

As an anthropologist, Sian was embarrassed by her past confusion. &#39;So I once thought Homo Erectus was a porno. Big deal.&#39; #badnovelopenings
&#39;We&#39;re not married anymore, Freda. Not since you left me for that Lovejoy lookalike. The one who rode a Penny Farthing.&#39; #badnovelopenings
Drunk or not, Peter would have his day in Margate. &#39;Sexxx...&#39; he gurgled at the hotel porter. &#39;Baked beansss&#39; he slurred. #badnovelopenings
&#39;Piss off, Gary!&#39; Matt warned his dead brother. &#39;You can&#39;t have Jean. She&#39;s with Manuel now. Let her be. Move on.&#39; #badnovelopenings
&#39;Serendipity favours the fortunate.&#39; A vacuous platitude Larry&#39;s mum had lived by, before they ate her. #badnovelopenings

&#39;Daddy paid for everything!&#39; Elsie gloated. &#39;Even bought me a new moral compass. Doesn&#39;t work though.&#39; #badnovelopenings
Mike welled up at the thought of Bev. Why not call it the &#39;badger position&#39;? Or the &#39;whelk position&#39;? Why always &#39;doggy&#39;? #badnovelopenings
&quot;Today, a verb change&quot; Tiberius announced. &quot;From now on, &#39;snaking&#39; will hereby be known as &#39;eeling&#39;. No discussion.&quot; #badnovelopenings

Mum brushed away the tears on her lapel. &#39;Basil&#39;s your real dad, not Tamara. She was...my sister.&#39; #badnovelopenings
&#39;I am needing application of pleasure. Very soon.&#39; Helga was just as forceful in her clunky English as she was in the dojo #badnovelopenings
Doris&#39; dirty dog, Dodger, disintegrated, dying dutifully. #badnovelopenings
His warped smile made the trip almost unbearable. &#39;I was born under cover of tent&#39;. Sarn picked her words carefully #badnovelopenings
Duncan&#39;s head oscillated steadily, just as Rick James sang the opening to Super Freak. &#39;Very kinky girl!&#39; Dunc sniggered. #badnovelopenings

An elderly lady is showing me her toes on the train home. And she&#39;s the one looking worried...
@Katedavis121 I couldn&#39;t tell exactly...think she was concerned it was some kind of fungal infection. They weren&#39;t tasty toes, so maybe...
There&#39;s something inherently sexual about the way pro chefs jiggle their panhandles. Freud would have a field day...

Pop-speckled by the glitter shower, Gary&#39;s crutch gave out, tumbling him head first into the camp mess beneath him #badnovelopenings
&#39;I&#39;m not lying!&#39; Nick protested. &#39;I did see Ben deposit something formless into the dumpster.&#39; #badnovelopenings
@rltwright Glad you like! Not sure JHJ makes the list...but Kim Wilde&#39;s there...?
When I last met Mike he was bi. Now he was mono. His vision had worsened. Evidently. #badnovelopenings
Now, she could finally showcase her ears without fear of retribution. She was safe. Ned was just meat now. #badnovelopenings
&#39;12 inches!&#39; Gloria exclaimed, a little too loudly. &#39;Cor! That&#39;s the same as a foot! How you&#39;ve grown, Hammy!&#39; #badnovelopenings
The dove landed hastily for the last time, its organs in full view of the predator as they snagged on a loose branch. #badnovelopenings
Yeah, he&#39;d slept with a few guys. He was cool with it. Still did it for cash occasionally - even now he was President #badnovelopenings
O Benelux! Your depths astound and gratify, like the mayonnaise you&#39;re prized for, coating fries like a creamy embrace #badnovelopenings
Percival&#39;s gaze went beyond desire. It was a future together. Hand holding, kicking autumn leaves. Stupid stuff like that. #badnovelopenings
A swathe of dwindling gold light surrounded them. It was magical, like the first time. Except it was the last. #badnovelopenings
His chest rose and fell, undulating like the waves that were calling him. She knew it. But her tears fell nonetheless. #badnovelopenings
Clarence stood still, breathing her in once more. If he could take a scent with him, this would be it. This moment. #badnovelopenings
&#39;Nothing more can be done,&#39; he finally admitted. &#39;It&#39;s not gonna happen. Not while the dog&#39;s watching&#39; #badnovelopenings
He liked her, that was clear. Apart from her navel. That he could not abide. Body shots were out. #badnovelopenings
She drew him closer, whispering softly. &#39;There&#39;s shit on your slacks.&#39; #badnovelopenings
The cat purred loudly in ecstacy. Meow Meow was back in the game. #badnovelopenings
His tanned paunch hung loosely over his belt. &#39;D&#39;you want me to lose the jeans too?&#39; He bellowed saucily #badnovelopenings
She could never love him in the same way. Not while she was coated in breadcrumbs. He called her his &#39;Sexy Findus Pancake&#39; #badnovelopenings
&#39;Beetroot?!&#39; Margot screamed. &#39;Beet-harking-root?! More like parsnips, given his shoddy beige appearance!&#39; #badnovelopenings
&#39;Stop it Pedro! You&#39;re in the wrong bit. Use your hands like I showed you...that&#39;s it! Now bite down. Hard. #badnovelopenings
Dean&#39;s stomach growled loudly. He tried to pass off the noise as an anal eruption, but Freda knew the truth #badnovelopenings
&#39;So...who do you love then?&#39; Steve enquired. &#39;Me? Doug? Penny? Or is it Marduk? It&#39;s sooo Marduk isn&#39;t it??&#39; #badnovelopenings
&#39;Get lost!&#39; Sally yelled. &#39;I am lost,&#39; replied Loz. &#39;In your eyes. They&#39;re beautiful. Especially the left one.&#39; #badnovelopenings
&#39;Next time I go on a date it&#39;ll be with Simon,&#39; Bina decided. &#39;Or Mikey. Maybe Del. But not Old Waxy. No way.&#39; #badnovelopenings
The smell grew more pungent the nearer they got to the socket. Their screams were silenced by the spectacle before them.  #badnovelopenings
It went beyond the rational. Even the diseased badgers mattered. Brian kissed their decaying flesh, weeping #badnovelopenings #fanfiction
If I was a girl, I should like to be known as Amy Hamburger. Or Rebecca Galleria. #demsmoneynames
I&#39;d be proper hot too. And I&#39;d know it. If I was a girl. Like headturning hot. And I&#39;d show it.
Sol flicked his cigar at the quaking stripper. &#39;C&#39;mon Sugar Tits, dance!&#39; He was more abusive than most ten year olds. #badnovelopenings
Gurning was second nature to Phil. Mouth covers &#39;tache covers nose covers brow covers head. He&#39;d win, for sure. #badnovelopenings
&#39;I see you&#39;re quite the squirter!&#39; Hans said. still sopping wet. &#39;My turn to emit!&#39; He announced, taking the water pistol #badnovelopenings
&#39;Gaaahhhhhd!&#39; The voice became clearer as Gina approached the bedroom. &#39;That&#39;s some loud praying!&#39; She thought to herself. #badnovelopenings
&#39;Forward-leaning anus gyration, known as &#39;twerking&#39;, joins murder, incest, and cannibalism as Satan&#39;s handiwork&#39; he said. #badnovelopenings
Jason sniffed another line. &#39;Bastard semi-quavers always get stuck in me nose!&#39; He moaned, picking a second sheet of music #badnovelopenings
Bert didn&#39;t care. As a dog, he&#39;d been neutered a week ago. As a parrot however, it was a different story. #badnovelopenings
Chunna had always hated her name. &#39;It&#39;s more a deaf-mute enunciation than a name!&#39; Tinabopeep had teased. #badnovelopenings
&#39;I want you. Even the bruised bits. I&#39;ve got bruises too. Remember when you hit me with the ketchup? Kept that bruise.&#39; #badnovelopenings
B&#39;Jesus! B&#39;Jesus! Budgie&#39;s Ass!

&#39;Tit Milk Tara, the terrific Turkish tart, tantalisingly tumbled toward Toronto.&#39; Milo&#39;s recital met rapturous applause. #badnovelopenings
&#39;Mummy, oh mummy!&#39; Sadie called. &#39;Got my leather catsuit? Got it for me, mummy? Yeah? Got it? Leather puss-in-suit?&#39; #badnovelopenings
&#39;Slutting&#39;s hard,&#39; Tina said to her feet. &#39;I need a chemical peel.&#39; So she made one. Out of loo block and paint. #badnovelopenings
&#39;I&#39;ve never seen one,&#39; she said innocently. &#39;May I see yours, Pablo?&#39; He stood still, letting her explore his tepid scalp #badnovelopenings

A train host is a curious creature; one that can munch crisps, facetime friends, and still show vague disinterest in passengers&#39; concerns.
The train host also sports a scouse brow and a strong Brum accent.Although an employee, she wears civilian clothes, adding to the mystery...
O train host, your mild contempt is thinly veiled laziness. Overcompensating for your insecurities, you exude crude arrogance...
O train host you shall be counted among the vacuous on the Day of Judgement. But munch on crisps in your ignorance...
O train host your hair is near white, yet your thick brows are black as night. Painted caterpillars bridging forehead and eyesight...
O train host I implore you; resist the urge to broadcast hopes and fears to your captive audience. Seek redemption and peace, o train host.
