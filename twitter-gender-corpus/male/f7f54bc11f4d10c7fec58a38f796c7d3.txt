@BrendanSinclair does that count Planet of the Apes?
Nothing like a packed train going out of service right at West Oakland.
I&#39;ll deal with more GDC stuff tomorrow. Now to &quot;play&quot; some FF13.
@jasonbertrand I hope it really was black and white.
Deus Ex&#39;s triangular art style just makes me think the artists forgot to smooth out the models.
A few hours behind, but heading to GDC now.
@iocat hey I&#39;m following you one here now. Got my GDC stuff so maybe I&#39;ll run into you.
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse, the flying machine controlled by an iphone or the human hamster ball.
Ah late night GDC bart. I look up and see two badass Backbone designer friends standing over me.
@ThierryNguyen I was wondering where you were. Yellow to Red some other day.
@rdb_aaa The show just needs more NBA Jam music. Seriously that stuff is frontier epic.
@The_Katbot That video reminded me that Probotector was a real game and not some black market Contra knock-off
Damn, chapter 8 of Final Fantasy 13 went from childish to fucking dark in minutes.
FF13&#39;s 360 &quot;Extras&quot; menu is a nice touch.
Final boss of FF13&#39;s chapter 11 is freaking intense. It could top my list of all FF fights.
@ThierryNguyen I leave the hacked turret around a corner and lure guards into it. Also Icarus slam China.
Didn&#39;t really expect Final Fantasy 13&#39;s ending. First thing I did was look at the logo on the game box.
Wow, the new Wacom Inkling looks impressive:http://youtu.be/fXbBA1DRE84&nbsp;
For those that had problems with the third boss in Deus Ex HR, this glitch is amazing:http://youtu.be/4v1X5F0d58I&nbsp;
Nerf Heavy Lifting Augmentations http://youtu.be/0l3wOT9cSg4&nbsp;?
@pkollar  Could have been worse. Could have tasted like Black Eyed Peas. And I don&#39;t mean soul food.
@gamespite SOUND. It finally exists.
@nsuttner I&#39;d be more worried if they were &quot;on par&quot;.
My cab driver ranted about the President, German History, and then stopped to repair his shoe. Worth it as I got a giant sized Gears 3.

Damn you FF14, not getting in Alpha but still having a MMO craving has made me start up FF11 again.
Time to try Dark Souls as a meager Cleric. Hope From Software invades.
I wrote a little about Dark Souls, but mostly rant about Temple of Elemental Evil and GOG http://l.gamespot.com/pzEYcb&nbsp;
@pkollar @jamesmielke I gave up on both the Cleric and Sorcerer. Rocking a great sword Warrior and breezing for now.
@CTWatters I decided to call it a day after fighting three giants that dropped &quot;dung pies&quot;.
@jasonschreier @kobunheat if it&#39;s not Ivalice related, it damaged the brand.
Linking a Square Enix I.D. to PlayOnline Seems more of a nuisance than actually helpful.
Got invaded for the first time in Dark Souls. He dropped 11000 Souls. Next time try rolling.
@pkollar the one in the alley? Just walk up the stairs and drop on him. Or do you fight him twice!?
@pkollar run up the stairs and onto the ledge. Then drop down and he&#39;ll chase you in a loop. Run fast and drop on him.
@pkollar aren&#39;t you strong enough that the dogs are one hit KO?
@pkollar time to make an Intelligence GREATSWORD.
@pkollar probably not, but that would kick ass. I&#39;m still hunting for more crafting items passed +6
@pkollar get a weapon to +5 and you can start modify it towards elements, magic, stats and others. You can undo upgrades but loose the mats.
Welp, blue phantoms can&#39;t use Estus flasks. Sorry host dude.
@fiddlecub what&#39;s passed Ceaseless Discharge? These Capras and Tuarus are getting annoying.
@vanjnguyen the Parish is quicker and cheaper.
@fiddlecub ok, so giving up was the right choice for now. Also being summoned with little health blows.
@pkollar how much life do you have? Only did half a bar at 800.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk yikes I&#39;m level 59 after that Sen&#39;s Fortress boss. Too much grinding and dying.
@pkollar downed an Estus+2 after every firewave then hit him twice. Won after 16 club slams.
@pkollar nope, think you have to beat the dragon knight and fatty first for the item.
@fiddlecub I could take Sen&#39;s Fortress and Anor Londo, but Demon Ruins&#39; bosses as normal enemies is too much.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk did anyone fight the painting boss? I just walked away so I didn&#39;t lose 40k souls.
@pkollar any clue how to reach the catacombs black smith? I warped out after finding the princess.
@pkollar those skelewheels cornered me near a wall that had a hammer clanking. Assuming it&#39;s a smith.
@pkollar well all the Lord Soul areas are crazy. One is pitch black, while another has invisible bridges.
@fiddlecub I&#39;m cringing getting to the Lord Souls. Let me know if you beat one.
@fiddlecub where the heck am I going after the centipede? If it&#39;s into the lava I&#39;ll be peeved.
@larrrk joined the Gravelords, had to kill Nito anyway.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk found any of the second embers for Normal/Divine/Fire? I can&#39;t get above +10/+5
@Larrrk switch in basement with the wheel skelies. I found it as a phantom. As a human I glitched the dragon with a strong attack.
@Gamespot Dark Souls user: &quot;Will there be a walkthrough on how to get beards? Seriously, I couldn&#39;t find the option anywhere. Disappointed.&quot;
The news mainly makes want to rewatch Pirates of Silicon Valley. The Windows unboxing is so great, even if  Jobs and Gates had lines fliped.
@larrrk Sparky the crow in Undead Asylum will trade each moss for 4 Twinkling Titanite total.
@Larrrk @vanjnguyen Asylum Sparky will also trade Skull Lantern for Forest Hunter ring.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk @vanjnguyen Two bosses left.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk Finished Dark Souls. Also spoiled the ending for @vanjnguyen
@pkollar you&#39;re getting a little too kinky for Twitter there.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk @vanjnguyen wow I read my time wrong, it was only 68 hours long.
@vanjnguyen eagle shield or any tower shield blocked them really well.
@jamesmielke you&#39;ll love the cats and mushrooms.
@carolynmichelle @fiddlecub conundrum: how long would Batman survive in Lordran? I&#39;d say until Darkroot.
@fiddlecub if this Soul Calibur 5 rumor is true, you might have a &quot;hidden&quot; interest in the gamehttp://aol.it/qAU2j0&nbsp;
@fiddlecub time to pay Oswald in the Parish 4562783 billion souls to make everything normal.

19 st freak show is in full circle. Everyone is loud &amp; drunk, driver is getting surly, &amp; a guy was hauling ass with a fist full of puppies.
@EddieMakuch in his case is it short for Murderhands?
At&amp;t continues to be the most incompetent company. They are trying to steal $150 of my money on an account that doesn&#39;t exist.
@ATT is comprised completely of fucktards.
The fire department is rescuing my neighbors trapped in the elevator. I think I&#39;ll take the stairs for the next week.
@carolynmichelle let&#39;s hope that Latex Babes of Estros becomes a real full game.
Almost a full hour on the phone with criminal organization AT&amp;T. Nothing but run arounds and flatout lies.

@taswell Only if it also meant slammers.
Sweet, Tactics  Ogre remake for PSP http://bit.ly/bDitHR
The line for takoyaki is absurd. I&#39;ll get BBQ ribs first.
@ThierryNguyen  We got at least three copies over here and can&#39;t install. I just want to play the Campaign, too.
@pkollar I just spent $1200 to PC Game again. Conclusion: pretty dead, I&#39;d say.
@pkollar But dude, I&#39;m getting a Dell.
Unlike most everyone else, I think I&#39;ll just wait for the digital Starcraft 2 unlock tomorrow morning. I do have a retail box, though.
SC2 name: GSFragSeid, friend code: 487
32 marines + 16 medics may have been overkill for mission 2.
@ThierryNguyen @pkollar I got to appreciate a game that stores save games as sleeping people.
I think SC2 installed faster on my home PC than here at the GameSpot office.
Well, glad I didn&#39;t get stuck in this Starcraft 2 queue. http://twitpic.com/29754c
Oh, Starcraft 2&#39;s built in screenshot button even picks up Fraps&#39; FPS counter. Better turn that off.
Neat, a campaign mission where I can pick sides. I chose the Protoss option, though guess it means I&#39;ll have to play the mission twice.
Grabbed the @eastbayexpress on my way to bart. One of the articles is about @robertashley . It&#39;s like worlds colliding.
According to an irate e-mail CBSi and GameSpot published Dungeon Siege 3 and &quot;The way it is your game sucks!&quot;
Didn&#39;t get any &quot;Maw of the Void&quot; achievements due to a Battle.net error. Will now proceed to beat Starcraft 2 without having &quot;Played&quot; it.
$478 glasses. Thank god for eye insurance.
I&#39;ll be giving out Torchlight 2 Beta codes on Twitter later today. Tell your friends, or hoard them for yourself.
@NormalMode @pkollar Is Phil gonna be in the background of http://kink.com&nbsp;?
I have 16 Torchlight 2 Beta keys. Here&#39;s two: 3AC2-D2C1-C6AF-4AF7 and 8FB0-84F1-94C2-46EB. Redeem them at https://secure.runicgames.com/signup&nbsp;
Here&#39;s the third #Torchlight2 beta code: 6B49-8E11-5E38-4E39
@vcharette1 it appears @Skadavr had the fastest trigger finger.
Use this #Torchlight2 Beta key to become a steam powered choo choo train Engineer:  6540-277F-6780-4061
@EyTay I Think I saw your followers go from 47 to 190, and then back down to 90.
The missing digits of this #Torchlight2 beta code are delicious flavors of hepatitis: 4E53-?9?8-32?4-4D45
I don&#39;t think you want to admit that about hep. RT @NathanChatham: @KurtisSeid Got it, thanks!
The missing digits of this #Torchlight2 beta code stand for the company that brought the Avengers to arcades: 94BF-55??-BAFE-439E
This beta key is backwards, so you’ll need to type it out instead of just copypasta: 2364-A1C4-3868-75E7
Both these codes have mixed-up sections, but if you solve either you’ll have TWO keys: 82C1-0FD4-8163-4A6B | 6E6E-17AA-EE9E-4A7B
Nothing creative about these next two Torchlight 2 Beta keys. Just take &#39;em: 5B20-7764-5930-4D48 and 81BF-3D61-1CA7-43E4.
@CTWatters Is it the one docked in Alameda harbor?
@Vinkel176 Thanks for the offer, but I&#39;m already in!
Now for an infuriating one, 14 digits of this beta key are scrambled (Only the first 0 and 3 are in the right place): 0011-2234-489B-BDDE
Alright that last puzzle was absurd, so here&#39;s a free Torchlight 2 beta key: C40F-B6F2-C662-40C8
These lost digits are for the Final Fantasy game that informed me that I had been playing for MORE than 200 days: ??36-E817-687B-41B3
The missing digits of this #Torchlight2 beta key are how old I’ll be tomorrow (Hint: I’m not 80): 45C8-BF9B-AB0?-44?E
Surprise fools. #Torchlight2 Beta key for the insomniacs and duders in shit timezones: C7F4-4AF4-9758-4F56
I&#39;ll be streaming old diablo games until midnight: http://www.gamespot.com/shows/gamespot-live/?event=diablo_live_marathon20120514&nbsp;…
Also we are giving out six free copies of Diablo 3 during this stream.
Racing against EBMUD, BART, OPD, Clorox, and Kaiser in Oakland&#39;s Jack London Square  Saturday morning.
Diablo 317002: Error of Destruction
GameSpot is streaming old Metal Gear games, and I&#39;ll be joining in for MGS3 (maybe MGS2 as well) http://www.gamespot.com/shows/gamespot-live/?event=mgs_vghm_051612&nbsp;…
@jasonschreier Should have gone Monk. And if you did, what&#39;s wrong with you?

Why did Dragons Dogma&#39;s English theme song retool lines about television and phone calls? It could probably work in a high fantasy setting.
I&#39;ll be streaming classic Zelda games along with @TomMcShea at 11 am PST: http://www.gamespot.com/shows/gamespot-live/?event=zelda_live_marathon20120523&nbsp;…
I&#39;m soaked and groady after racing in Jack London&#39;s Paddle for Life fund raiser www.paddleforlife.org
@fakeimmigrant I like to think of him as the Red White and Blue Goblin.
@carolynmichelle at least you&#39;re about relevant topics. Most of my tweets will be about spaghetti.
I might have played Diablo 3 some more if my account didn&#39;t get hacked. Guess I&#39;ll try Nightmare with no equipment or money.
@EyTay I&#39;m trying the recovering thing first. Besides, it&#39;s a pretty boring game.
@smcinnis the secret is that&#39;s what @Larrrk &#39;s desk is like all the time.
Laundry, dishes, packing, laser tag. Sounds like standard E3 prep.
A large group of 5 year olds just screamed about much they love Call of Duty.
This Old Spaghetti [from a] Factory will fuel me for the rest of my packing.
Now to eat all the perishable food in my fridge. Milk-Apple Sauce-Teriyaki Chicken Wings are go.
The plane has landed. I&#39;m wearing too many layers and kind of deaf.
@smcinnis @Synthia_GS you are now fold out soulmates.
E3 is getting in the way of Game of Thrones and Mad Men. Time to amend this problem.
@randolphramsay does that stage conduct lightning?
So does Resident Evil 6 not have Kinect support? I wanted to order Chris Redfield to punch boulders.
@BrendanSinclair It&#39;s Games Pote 3, thank you very much.
They probably made Gears 4 a prequel so they won&#39;t have to deal with Baird&#39;s beard. It would have been beefy and made of bees.
@BrendanSinclair just had a Canadian melt down.
@pkollar if a sport has feet, it&#39;s football. See: kick boxing.
Need for Speed: Prodigy. Most importantly it&#39;s about an old web service.
@randolphramsay Someone with rabies?
Ubisoft trainwreck is go!
Tigers, tits, explosions, TV fire traps, and bows. Ubisoft is doing some mondo shit with Far Cry 3
@guycocker It&#39;s the circle of life.
And so Ubisoft closes on a shit burger called Shootmania.
Watch Dogs looks pretty badass. I love the multiplayer idea of each person taking a different part in the story.
Wait, the Vita now includes free Crystal Light? Lemonade sounds great.
Sony: &quot;Children today are stupid and don&#39;t understand books.&quot;
@fiddlecub teach your kids how to blast off faces with the power of books.
@EddieMakuch I don&#39;t recommend eating the wraps at E3, though. #GamespotE3
Got around to watching Mad Men. HOLY SHIT. And it&#39;s not even the season finale.
So does the Wii U have games? #GameSpote3
Hell yeah we can grief new friends over Super Mario Wii U..
Of course P3 and P4 get shafted with Toads. #GameSpotE3
Oh but P5 gets to be the touchscreen bitch #GameSpotE3
I hope Scribblenauts Unlimited is as tedious as the last game.
@gamespite It&#39;s good to hate kids, though.
Reggie is self aware! #GameSpotE3
Wii U: Play games with your ass. #GameSpotE3
@fakeimmigrant I don&#39;t know, if it&#39;s like Wii Fit we might be playing with our anuses.
@marcowhereru @gamespot evolving...into epic yarn!?!?!
Is this Lego Watch Dogs? #GameSpotE3
Well nintendo is dead. Good Night #E3
Played some Crysis 3, heard the crazy plot. Writing my impressions now #GameSpotE3

Reggie is checking out Dust 514 over at the Playstation 3 booth. He looks stern even on the show room floor.

@carolynmichelle @TomMcShea Those are some strong friendships.

Reading about Mad Men, listening to Super Castlevania 4 music, drinking tea with cream. This morning is odd.
@MrToffee Next time get lamb chops.
Woke up in LA, hopped on a plane to NorCal, dropped off bags at home, watched Prometheus IMAX 3D in a packed theatre, now for sleep.
I&#39;ve been stuck in BART limbo for almost an hour, and it&#39;s gonna get worse.
I should have stayed at home when the bay bridge traffic clogged all the way to Rockridge.
It took 2 hours to get to the office. For my coworkers that decided to stay home, you made the right choice.

AT&amp;T remains a terrible company. They deactivated my old BlackBerry without activating my new Nitro. I have no phone for who knows how long.
The Mass Effect &quot;Anime&quot; looks terrible http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af6tA206Y6Q&amp;feature=player_embedded&nbsp;…

@pkollar robot limbs!
SFMOMA has some batshit insane exhibits. I love it!
It&#39;s my last day with cbs. Thanks to everyone for a great two+ years!
Watching Bruce Lee&#39;s Fists of Fury and Jet Li&#39;s Fist of Legend back-to-back. Now I just need that crappy Jackie Chan version.
Ten hours into my day and only now do I realize my socks are mismatched.

Worst thing in Final Fantasy 14 so far are quests that are not won by combat or fetching items, but by emoting randomly.
Got my toenails sliced off at Kaiser. Time to eat unagi at Geta while I&#39;m nearby.
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m sleepy at 4:30pm or if PGA golf is just the most boring shit known to man.

@The_Katbot I feel bad for people who weren&#39;t already into RPGs by the SNES or even NES era.
@The_Katbot What!? FF4 and CT already had me hooked. At least once I realized I could heal my party...
@The_Katbot I played the hell out of Falcom PC games back then too. Though, Y&#39;s and Xanadu were more action RPGs.
Bad close captions are great: the Republican debate with &quot;TDiane Swerenson&quot; and &quot;George Stefonopolis&quot;.

@pkollar amazon shipped my copy already. No turning back now.
Using a comma instead of a period can be a pretty bad typo. But I&#39;d gladly accept  2,500,000 worth of CBS stock into my 401k.

Jwipo tastes good but it&#39;s a pain to eat. Who would think to fry jerky?
@EpicNameBro I&#39;ve gotten so used to mid-rolling (and fat rolling) that I can&#39;t handle the speed of fast movement.
@EpicNameBro The first build I beat DkS with was 40 strength, Large Club, Full Stone Knight Set &amp; Eagle Shield. Sometimes I couldn&#39;t roll.
So I did end up going to OB Town. If you&#39;re in Berkeley they have an absurd happy deal; four huge dishes at $20 before 7pm

Is the PS4 backwards compatible!? Screw new features, I&#39;m just going to use it to play Final Fantasy Tactics.

@jasonschreier I spent the last week playing PS1 games. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m hyped for new releases.
@jasonschreier at least that&#39;s somewhat recent. I&#39;m going through Front Mission 3 and Final Fantasy Tactics for like the tenth time.
@Pseudobread I refuse to believe that&#39;s a real thing. Nope. Never.
@fiddlecub Galerians claimed 50 hours of gameplay, but it was like a 6 hour survival horror http://i2.listal.com/image/1109884/600full-galerians-cover.jpg&nbsp;…

Stumbled into a drag queen bachelorette party at AsiaSF.
A night is pretty successful when the thought &quot;I&#39;m exhausted&quot; quickly leads to &quot;I need fried chicken&quot;.
@MikeJMika let me clarify: I didn&#39;t know there was a bachelorette party. The drag queens were supposed to be for everyone.
&quot;The reason you are no longer working for the above employer is: STILL WORKING FOR EMPLOYER&quot;

@pkollar wondering how much of the PS3 version you played. Fates are awful as it loads PCs/pets before mobs - who often spawn dead.
@pkollar Svara and the fate chain in north Dragonhead almost consisted of nothing but SMN ifrits and titans.
@fiddlecub curious if you got to Titan or Qarn. Those really upped the craziness of combat.

Is Dragon&#39;s Dogma Dark Arisen on sale? It is? Black Friday shopping complete.
Reading the @gamespot Tactics Ogre forums makes me aware that people can&#39;t tell the difference between freedom and evil.
Emery-go-round &quot;stop requested&quot; sounds like&quot; stop requesting&quot;.
@gamespot instant office groan: describe anything as &quot;Dynasty Warriors-ish&quot;.
Is @tacticsogregame cutting into my @dragonage time, or is it the other way around? At least I&#39;ve beaten one of them.
@lauralovescake that pretty much describes most of the Bay Area
Lunch with the boys at Maxis. Good times.
15 @gamespot editors out at Buca Di Beppo, yet we order for 30+.

Great, if anything happens I have a career as @smcinnis &#39;s adopted man child.

Another fine CBS program that @gamespot can attest is very accurate to modern PC gaming: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRhGPVYRsOY
@pkollar that&#39;s where most of the replay comes from. So much can go down in the Deep roads based on your party. Who did you take?
@pkollar if you play through a second time try switching out Fenris for your sibling.
@jasonschreier I&#39;m sure the codes themselves will be 3D. Or you will need 3 codes--1 per each D.

@fiddlecub Lego Paul Harvey, Lego 60 Minutes with Andy Rooney, Lego Johnnie Walker Black, Lego Mavis Beacon, Lego Debbie Does Dallas.
@justicecovert seems my Worgen got hacked, leaving a free month of a game I don&#39;t play. Must have really wanted in the empty guild vault.
According to my blackberry, the last time I checked twitter was 111 days ago. I&#39;ll try to keep that up.
@justicecovert they are both cutting into Texas Instruments&#39; profits.
Main advantage of the early shift: snagging Dragon Age 3+ hours before the normal rush.
@gamespite DW even came with an out right plea from Enix to buy the sequel.
Hello Dragon Age! Goodbye social interaction. Like I even did that!
@The_Katbot going dwarf noble rogue. Royal backstabbing for all. Still undecided about sex.
Ugh the Fade is brutal and confusing as a Rogue archer. Also, minced pies! #dragonage
@aliceingameland thanks for the mental image. Sounds like a gangrape wendsday.
Wuh? Even Dragon Age has plot battles you&#39;re meant to lose? I always hate that design.
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s better: the guy talking about building your own R2-D2, or the guy signing how to build your own R2-D2.
I wonder how many people are here to listen about this soon to be canceled Fox show, or are just getting an early seat for Thundercats.
@carolynmichelle make sure to also &quot;star&quot;, &quot;coin&quot; and &quot;red power fist&quot; strangers when you can.
@pkollar Hmmm guess I should check this podcast out considering I beat Dragon Age like 15 minutes ago.
Took about ~30 hours to beat Dragon Age without side quests (except getting Shale). The ending I got was rather lacking.
This took me close to 90 minutes to build. Hopefully I&#39;ll put it to good use. http://twitpic.com/4hgqhi
@pkollar it would have come up sooner if Homefront also had some kind of BBQ product placement.
@rdb_aaa better start injecting coffee directly into your blood stream.
@gamespot @EddieMakuch doesn&#39;t &#39;going gold&#39; typically mean when they send the game to the manufacture? It would be a little late.
@iocat Tales of the Abyss, Tactics Ogre, Grandia 2, Growlanser, Suikoden 3 and 5, Valkyrie Profile, Chrono Trigger.
Ah man, only one DA:O Ranger can summon at a time? There goes my plan for a Bear army.
@pkollar I can&#39;t keep the seasons straight. Which one was 3? I&#39;m trying to avoid spoiling EVERYTHING.
@fiddlecub @smcinnis I&#39;ll go ahead and be a weirdo and say Portable Ops. That is an absurd package for a PSP game.
@pkollar honestly that&#39;s probably my least favorite as it&#39;s sandwiched between two even more amazing seasons. Though 3 does have Romo.
@gamespite you better also be playing them all at once.
@pkollar @LonoSG works even better if your Shepard was a woman.
@garylu they really need to accept Elvish or Klingon as well.
@The_Katbot Shep&#39;s gender is one thing. But clearly that impostor is some Paragon Spacer War Hero blow hard.
GameSpot is hiring a sports game editor: http://bit.ly/fEJf2G
@jasonschreier I think that would mainly just annoy copy edit.
@dimortuisunt you can attempt to, but I&#39;d assume knowing sports is required.
@JayFrechette reserve the nudity for sweeps. Or be nonchalant about no pants.
First piece of free Sega swag: A Phantasy Star Zero Rappy shirt.
I rant with @fiddlecub and @carolynmichelle about Dragon Age 2 funk in this Spoilercast http://tinyurl.com/3lwj9c2
@jasonschreier Tetris. That ending left me hanging for more.
Dragon Age actually makes me want to listen to Jared Leto. What a strange turn of events.
@smcinnis the official term is Atmosphere Bonanzas.
Warden&#39;s Keep really wasn&#39;t worth the MS points. 560 for something way too short.
Alright, the Kryptonian sword and the Kents made Dragon Age dlc kind of worth it.
@aliceingameland it&#39;s entertaining enough, and the moments of nerd rage are well worth it.
@fiddlecub you make that sound like an HR violation.
@pkollar for a twist my money is that it&#39;s Neve Campbell this time.
Well, Last.Fm on Xbox reaffirms my eclectic music taste by recomending both Chris Cross and Kriss Kross.
@nsuttner special snow cones for orphans.
Listening to the old 1994 Mortal Kombat 1 soundtrack. Nice to know most sites have the lyric &quot;Warrior&quot; listed as &quot;Why you wear?&quot;.
Not sure if I actually like Gyromancer yet, but there is something addictive to it.
Oh right, debug and retail Live are on different planes of existance. That will teach me to try and get Vandal Hearts for free.
&quot;Fountain Sandwich Special&quot; just makes me think they have grilled cheese on tap.
@The_Katbot I&#39;m just glad there is an excuse to blare the terrible 1994 MK soundtrack.
@jasonschreier depending on how far you are that could be a spoiler.
I love dumb reader comments: &quot;GameSpot doesn&#39;t know about games. Portal 2 doesn&#39;t have multiplayer, only Co-Op.&quot;
@gamespite Chill, Spark, Armored, Launch, Boomer, Sting, Storm, and last Flame.
I just realized Buckaroo Banzai and the Get It Shawty music video were filmed in the same location. Those would make a weird crossover.
@pkollar news flash: stupid people exist.
I can&#39;t tell if this Sony conference stream is lagging, or if they are pausing to think.
@pkollar a Kollar Koran? Khrist.
@gamespite @ferricide @EvilSharkey you&#39;re gonna get Rangda Bangda&#39;d.
Hell yeah to bbe&#39;s binary solo at umloud with no doubt&#39;s just a girl!
The lego band is musically terrible, but the showmanship makes up for it two fold.
@sophiatong out the latter and into the former.
@pkollar my body is ready. My sanity...not so good.
I am shocked that VGMusic.com is still kicking, and using the same n64/MMX3 logo. Follow them: @vgmusic
@EvilSharkey now is a good a time as any to make bathtub moonshine.

@fiddlecub you&#39;re working some kind of voodoo. I&#39;m about to eat mashed potatoes, and I don&#39;t normally like them!
@fiddlecub don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve tried it, but some QTEs are broken with a gamepad. I couldn&#39;t block during fist fights.
Had too much English breakfast, so I jogged from Collins-Geary to Powell-Market. Probably not enough.
Also both the Japan Town mall and Westfield are janky these days.
@pkollar_live Sell every piece of loot (Except Teleport stones). It&#39;s what they are designed for.
@pkollar_live the chests are in Lowtown near Dalan&#39;s, the two in the palace cellar, a few in the prison stash, and the ones in Phon coast.
@pkollar_live It&#39;s in the Henne Mines, but the drop rate is REALLY low. Also the best great sword and katana are nearly as good.
@iocat sounds like food poisoning in the wake.
heading down to LA for the craziness that is E3.
Something is up with my E3 hotel room when I can shower and watch tv at the same time.
Now you can say in real time &quot;I&#39;m Commander Shepard and this my favorite store on the Citadel.&quot;
Yes Ghost Recon jazz hands.
Can we just call it Fourza for simplification?
@pkollar &quot;Dropped on your head with Kinect&quot;

@Larrrk head east to Vegas.
@Larrrk go to Andersons pea soup. It sucks ass.
@Aussie_Kozy @Larrrk I don&#39;t advise driving back to Australia. Might be a little too wet.

I interviewed the devs about the new Star Trek game: http://l.gamespot.com/lLpcY6
It&#39;s looking like @GSJody might be the last of the @gamespot crew stuck in LA.
@smcinnis @noreentahir consider this concept: whole watermelon pan fried  in batter.
@carolynmichelle it gets even crazier when you see a colleuge interview a dev you know, but they clearly don&#39;t know each other.
@gamespite did the food taste like him though?
@fiddlecub shout, let it all out: the dreams in which I&#39;m dying are the best I&#39;ve ever had.
A little AvP with a few reviewers. I think I team killed someone from Game Informer.
I must be getting old. My black friday shopping was linens and luggage. Not a single game or software.
My poor video card makes Mass Effect 2 look like Half Life 2. I&#39;ll pick up the 360 version when I fix the red ring issue.
@aliceingameland are you telling me Britain doest run on magic!?
Damn near everything on Ilium makes Mass Effect 2 even better. Eternity bar is the place to be.
I too keep getting this crash in Mass Effect 2: http://tiny.cc/NtAEi . Made the Horizon battle a real pain.
Damn, +45 Renagade for getting the secret 12th squadmate in Mass Effect 2. It was a pretty F&#39;d up scene, too.
@randolphramsay @sophiatong we didn&#39;t wait long enough for the waiter to bring it back. It&#39;s an IOU from Mortons now.
@randolphramsay @sophiatong on the flip side I had a The Standard steak first thing in the morning.
After how cool, funny and interesting Shale was in Dragon Age, Zaeed from Mass Effect 2 is kind of a let down DLC character. Useful at least
@The_Katbot Nintendo EU got us a SUPER English build of what I&#39;ve branded Soulatouroubou.
In my game of Mass Effect 2, both Shepard and Garrus have solved diplomatic arguments with headbutts. I hope Tali gets the same option.
Figures Loghain and Morrigan are Quarians. Their suits are even the same colors.
Time to start loading the Kindle with stuff. First up, Patriot Games or The Hunt for Red October? I&#39;ve read neither before.
Keep crashing on the IFF misson, so time to start Mass Effect 2 again on Xbox.
One international plug adapter packed, but 5 separate plugs for my phone, camera, kindle, psp, and ipod. Hope I won&#39;t need most of those.
LHR has some terrible wi-fi. Time to start the day right by tracking down a steak and ale pie with HP sauce.
@smcinnis think of it as a mystical adventure, but with more handle bar baskets.
Since Cape Town I&#39;ve been on planes for 26+ hours. It&#39;s 9pm in California too, right?
I kind of want to play NES World Cup now, but Japan is always an early minor opponent. Also the last boss being West Germany.
@eddie_not_eddy maybe if it includes Surf Ninjas and Spy Hard.
@jasonschreier @pkollar I hope the next book is a prequel of James just being a dick.
Still have slight jet lag insomnia. Woke up and felt the urge to try TF2 crafting. What is up with that?

PHantasy Star Online 2 looks amazing: http://youtu.be/BLWcqxmPGHI

@Rydog what, do you mean.

I&#39;ll deal with more GDC stuff tomorrow. Now to &quot;play&quot; some FF13.
@jasonbertrand I hope it really was black and white.
Deus Ex&#39;s triangular art style just makes me think the artists forgot to smooth out the models.
A few hours behind, but heading to GDC now.
@iocat hey I&#39;m following you one here now. Got my GDC stuff so maybe I&#39;ll run into you.
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse, the flying machine controlled by an iphone or the human hamster ball.
Ah late night GDC bart. I look up and see two badass Backbone designer friends standing over me.
@ThierryNguyen I was wondering where you were. Yellow to Red some other day.
@rdb_aaa The show just needs more NBA Jam music. Seriously that stuff is frontier epic.
@The_Katbot That video reminded me that Probotector was a real game and not some black market Contra knock-off
Damn, chapter 8 of Final Fantasy 13 went from childish to fucking dark in minutes.
FF13&#39;s 360 &quot;Extras&quot; menu is a nice touch.
Final boss of FF13&#39;s chapter 11 is freaking intense. It could top my list of all FF fights.
@ThierryNguyen I leave the hacked turret around a corner and lure guards into it. Also Icarus slam China.
Didn&#39;t really expect Final Fantasy 13&#39;s ending. First thing I did was look at the logo on the game box.
Wow, the new Wacom Inkling looks impressive:http://youtu.be/fXbBA1DRE84&nbsp;

@gamespite SOUND. It finally exists.
@nsuttner I&#39;d be more worried if they were &quot;on par&quot;.
My cab driver ranted about the President, German History, and then stopped to repair his shoe. Worth it as I got a giant sized Gears 3.

Damn you FF14, not getting in Alpha but still having a MMO craving has made me start up FF11 again.
Time to try Dark Souls as a meager Cleric. Hope From Software invades.
I wrote a little about Dark Souls, but mostly rant about Temple of Elemental Evil and GOG http://l.gamespot.com/pzEYcb&nbsp;
@pkollar @jamesmielke I gave up on both the Cleric and Sorcerer. Rocking a great sword Warrior and breezing for now.
@CTWatters I decided to call it a day after fighting three giants that dropped &quot;dung pies&quot;.
@jasonschreier @kobunheat if it&#39;s not Ivalice related, it damaged the brand.
Linking a Square Enix I.D. to PlayOnline Seems more of a nuisance than actually helpful.
Got invaded for the first time in Dark Souls. He dropped 11000 Souls. Next time try rolling.
@pkollar the one in the alley? Just walk up the stairs and drop on him. Or do you fight him twice!?
@pkollar run up the stairs and onto the ledge. Then drop down and he&#39;ll chase you in a loop. Run fast and drop on him.
@pkollar aren&#39;t you strong enough that the dogs are one hit KO?
@pkollar time to make an Intelligence GREATSWORD.
@pkollar probably not, but that would kick ass. I&#39;m still hunting for more crafting items passed +6
@pkollar get a weapon to +5 and you can start modify it towards elements, magic, stats and others. You can undo upgrades but loose the mats.
Welp, blue phantoms can&#39;t use Estus flasks. Sorry host dude.
@fiddlecub what&#39;s passed Ceaseless Discharge? These Capras and Tuarus are getting annoying.
@vanjnguyen the Parish is quicker and cheaper.
@fiddlecub ok, so giving up was the right choice for now. Also being summoned with little health blows.
@pkollar how much life do you have? Only did half a bar at 800.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk yikes I&#39;m level 59 after that Sen&#39;s Fortress boss. Too much grinding and dying.
@pkollar downed an Estus+2 after every firewave then hit him twice. Won after 16 club slams.
@pkollar nope, think you have to beat the dragon knight and fatty first for the item.
@fiddlecub I could take Sen&#39;s Fortress and Anor Londo, but Demon Ruins&#39; bosses as normal enemies is too much.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk did anyone fight the painting boss? I just walked away so I didn&#39;t lose 40k souls.
@pkollar any clue how to reach the catacombs black smith? I warped out after finding the princess.
@pkollar those skelewheels cornered me near a wall that had a hammer clanking. Assuming it&#39;s a smith.
@pkollar well all the Lord Soul areas are crazy. One is pitch black, while another has invisible bridges.
@fiddlecub I&#39;m cringing getting to the Lord Souls. Let me know if you beat one.
@fiddlecub where the heck am I going after the centipede? If it&#39;s into the lava I&#39;ll be peeved.
@larrrk joined the Gravelords, had to kill Nito anyway.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk found any of the second embers for Normal/Divine/Fire? I can&#39;t get above +10/+5
@Larrrk switch in basement with the wheel skelies. I found it as a phantom. As a human I glitched the dragon with a strong attack.
@Gamespot Dark Souls user: &quot;Will there be a walkthrough on how to get beards? Seriously, I couldn&#39;t find the option anywhere. Disappointed.&quot;
The news mainly makes want to rewatch Pirates of Silicon Valley. The Windows unboxing is so great, even if  Jobs and Gates had lines fliped.
@larrrk Sparky the crow in Undead Asylum will trade each moss for 4 Twinkling Titanite total.
@Larrrk @vanjnguyen Asylum Sparky will also trade Skull Lantern for Forest Hunter ring.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk @vanjnguyen Two bosses left.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk Finished Dark Souls. Also spoiled the ending for @vanjnguyen
@pkollar you&#39;re getting a little too kinky for Twitter there.
@fiddlecub @Larrrk @vanjnguyen wow I read my time wrong, it was only 68 hours long.
@vanjnguyen eagle shield or any tower shield blocked them really well.
@jamesmielke you&#39;ll love the cats and mushrooms.
@carolynmichelle @fiddlecub conundrum: how long would Batman survive in Lordran? I&#39;d say until Darkroot.
@fiddlecub if this Soul Calibur 5 rumor is true, you might have a &quot;hidden&quot; interest in the gamehttp://aol.it/qAU2j0&nbsp;
@fiddlecub time to pay Oswald in the Parish 4562783 billion souls to make everything normal.

@pkollar complexly naked sounds awesome.
Just ate bbq ribs on top of spaghetti. My body (and brain) is confused.

@BrendanSinclair are the $4 fake?
@jasonschreier oh god the hand to hand combat was so clunky. I loved it!
@jasonschreier also Drake hasn&#39;t saved the world with a comb, jar of old mayo, and half an eaten sandwich.
@gamespite I hope he makes Wright is a masochist anyway.
Wow, MTV might be on track again. Beavis and Butt-Head season 8 premiered tonight. 14 years later and it&#39;s th… (cont) http://deck.ly/~qGXyA&nbsp;
@jason_wilson I can think of a few corporations that poop.
@smcinnis is 80% of the city comprised of cheese and/or steak?
@fiddlecub can they steel-cut the parfait? I&#39;d go yogurt anyway.
Got to the BART station just as I realized I left my work at home. That was a fun dash back.
@jeffgerstmann @jamesmielke Is it bad that I hummed &quot;Part-Time Lover&quot; instead?
TF2 Scouts got nerfed again. Way to kill your last update, Valve.
I just played Phantasy Star Online followed by Diablo 2. Must have fallen in a timewarp.
@compellingpixel If those terrible photos of me came out ok, send them my way. I think it&#39;s time for a new lowbrow profile picture.
FFXIV dev team reorganised, more free months and the PS3 version delayed for who knows how long.
Updating Linkedin crap. It still linked to &quot;My Website&quot; which has been dead for almost a year.
@compellingpixel I&#39;m pretty sure I had more like 12 red bulls. Now for a new pic goal: http://tinyurl.com/df6kf5
Time to see how well i can make fried chicken
@omgmorejade Damn right it was awesome! Here&#39;s to crazy techno anime theme songs!

@Chufmoney I was disappointed that the the story did not in fact contain a Laser Wolf.
Starting Walking Dead thanks to @prettytony
Finished Book One of Walking Dead. Hope that Hershel guy gets fucked up later.
@twittch sexy robot vote: Guri from Shadows of the Empire. Though, no regular actress portrayed her/was an illustration.
@EddieMakuch typical weekend then?
@mikecruz_at1UP Good to know that I still use that hospital.
My name is Ted, and one day I&#39;ll be dead, yo, yo, yo http://tinyurl.com/227ewa
@carolynmichelle at least we&#39;re breaking even.
Touching the pilot light while cleaning the stove: not fun.
@omgmorejade Well, nothing enhances a dish’s aroma better than the souls of the living
After cleaning my apartment, it just looks barren. Had I been living in trash?
@rdb_aaa Your latest avatar is intense in the best way possible. Scanner battle?
Most of the CNET office I&#39;d huddled in the lobby to get free cookies.

Just got done knowing half the battle with @pkollar and @omgmorejade
The Old Republic&#39;s Flashpoints have amazing troll potential when you disagree and out roll your teammates during dialogue.
Jedi ally &quot;We&#39;ll do this peacefully&quot;, seconds before my Commando vetos and opens the air lock.
A little too much Goose and Juice, but home in one piece.
Molyneux talk was underwhelming.
They&#39;re finally tearing down the crack motel...Or planning to rebuild it as a super mutant-ultra mecha crack motel.
