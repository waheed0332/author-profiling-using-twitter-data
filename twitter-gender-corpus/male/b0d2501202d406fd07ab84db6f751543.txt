Google Instant ... cool stuff. I&#39;ve become accustomed to not having to hit Enter to get results in Outlook, now in Google as well.
Ah not &#39;search as you type&#39;: it predicts the likely final query based on partial input.. and shows the results. Much easier to do I suspect!
Google: we can save you eleven hours a second... hmmmm
Google Instant: ads also change as you type as well. Serious inflation in ad exposures while no one is looking!

Off to SharePoint 2009 in Las Vegas Sunday http://tinyurl.com/yc536g5. If you&#39;re there as well let us know!
SharePoint 2009 conference in Las Vegas: finally, the new search capabilities will be announced, albeit not available for a while yet.
SharePoint Server 2010 includes expanded MOSS functionality; FAST Search for SharePoint is new search based on FAST ESP.
FAST ESP is still available for eCommerce sites on Windows and Linux. Microsoft says they will continue to enhance and support ESP on Linux.
SP2009: moving from end user to developer tool; local hardware to cloud; and intranet sites to internet/web facing sites.
SPC2009: Real advantage of the MS cloud: mix and match what components are local and which are in the cloud; SQL Server local and cloud apps
SPC2009: Lots of talk about taxonomy management in SP2010; remains to be seen if that&#39;s just social tagging or generalized taxo tools.
SPC2009:FAST ESP for SharePoint only available on 64 bit platforms; not positive about SharePoint Server 2010 (hence Search Server)
SPC2009:Follow-up on 64 bit question: It looks like SharePoint and its search programs are all 64 bit apps. Taps for win32, I guess.
SPC2009: FAST Search for SharePoint retains the ESP paradigm of predictable scalability using rows &amp; columns of servers. Whew!
Freeway series? Do the LA fans realize the last &#39;freeway series&#39; had a pretty big earthquake at the start of game 2? October 17, 1989.
SPC2009:Today is search day. I&#39;m looking at 8 hours of deep dives, APIs, roadmaps and hands-on! What could be better for a search geek?:)
SPC2009: FAST finally talking about running in virtual systems, would like 4GB per vm; the guys are still nervous about high speed disks
SPC2009: Major usability improvements in FAST in SP - it looks like index profile can generally be updated in real time w/o re-index/etc
SPC2009: Wow. Significant new usability for admins/developers and even users in both SharePoint search products.
Cool article about entity extraction (property extraction) in FAST Search for SharePoint (FS4SP) bit.ly/gJziNK

Google Instant ... cool stuff. I&#39;ve become accustomed to not having to hit Enter to get results in Outlook, now in Google as well.
Ah not &#39;search as you type&#39;: it predicts the likely final query based on partial input.. and shows the results. Much easier to do I suspect!
Google: we can save you eleven hours a second... hmmmm

Off to SharePoint 2009 in Las Vegas Sunday http://tinyurl.com/yc536g5. If you&#39;re there as well let us know!
SharePoint 2009 conference in Las Vegas: finally, the new search capabilities will be announced, albeit not available for a while yet.
SharePoint Server 2010 includes expanded MOSS functionality; FAST Search for SharePoint is new search based on FAST ESP.
FAST ESP is still available for eCommerce sites on Windows and Linux. Microsoft says they will continue to enhance and support ESP on Linux.
SP2009: moving from end user to developer tool; local hardware to cloud; and intranet sites to internet/web facing sites.
SPC2009: Real advantage of the MS cloud: mix and match what components are local and which are in the cloud; SQL Server local and cloud apps
SPC2009: Lots of talk about taxonomy management in SP2010; remains to be seen if that&#39;s just social tagging or generalized taxo tools.
SPC2009:FAST ESP for SharePoint only available on 64 bit platforms; not positive about SharePoint Server 2010 (hence Search Server)
SPC2009:Follow-up on 64 bit question: It looks like SharePoint and its search programs are all 64 bit apps. Taps for win32, I guess.
SPC2009: FAST Search for SharePoint retains the ESP paradigm of predictable scalability using rows &amp; columns of servers. Whew!
Freeway series? Do the LA fans realize the last &#39;freeway series&#39; had a pretty big earthquake at the start of game 2? October 17, 1989.
SPC2009:Today is search day. I&#39;m looking at 8 hours of deep dives, APIs, roadmaps and hands-on! What could be better for a search geek?:)
SPC2009: FAST finally talking about running in virtual systems, would like 4GB per vm; the guys are still nervous about high speed disks
SPC2009: Major usability improvements in FAST in SP - it looks like index profile can generally be updated in real time w/o re-index/etc
SPC2009: Wow. Significant new usability for admins/developers and even users in both SharePoint search products.
Cool article about entity extraction (property extraction) in FAST Search for SharePoint (FS4SP) bit.ly/gJziNK
