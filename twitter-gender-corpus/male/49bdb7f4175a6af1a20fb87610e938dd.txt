@noahroth Depends on the altitude of the rocket....
Bus explosion reported in Tel Aviv, no news yet and not yet on major sites. #israel #hamas #terrorism #telaivv
@noahroth I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s time we flatten apartment buildings in Gaza. If there&#39;s a price to paid in innocent people, why is it ours?
@fundraisinisfun @noahroth You can agree or disagree with a land invasion, but it&#39;s not hasty, it&#39;s been on hold for almost a week now....
@LiorShemesh I thought about that during the intifada when I was living in Jerusalem. Good idea.
@jmp_nyc yep it started just after i tweeted that
@AntDeRosa are you truly as off as you&#39;re being quoted? Israel is targeting people who are attacking us. It&#39;s not numbers it&#39;s anti-terror
@KolYisrael where was the missile near Beit Shemesh? Lots of confusion here, no siren sounded in Beit Shemesh.
Gesture recognition deals by Samsung &amp; NEC http://goo.gl/rY7jp&nbsp; but microgestures are coming soon to mobile
@AntDeRosa @NewsOfMideast Hamas hasn&#39;t stopped rockets. What makes you think Israel&#39;s actions to now are sufficient to stop terror?

@HilzFuld How much do you have running? I get less than a day on my Galaxy S2, but that&#39;s with Skype and other things running all the time
@HilzFuld Do you run any always-on apps eg Skype? GPS? Use camera? Google+ other sync? I&#39;m curious if u get 2 days because of device or load
@HilzFuld wow that&#39;s double the mAh straight away. Nice!

@HilzFuld I wanted it to turn on the camera flash like my Omnia does, it just whites the LCD. So it&#39;s both useless and maybe malicious

@noahroth @HilzFuld @MarkKorman N see my comment on H&#39;s G+ thread https://plus.google.com/+HillelFuld/posts/5QfngWjnwdL&nbsp;… I think it&#39;s part of what you&#39;re trying to say
@noahroth but I don&#39;t agree re valuation. Its always relative, to current market, to future investors, etc. Its never objective value. Ever
@noahroth I usually agree but maybe component-feature software M&amp;A is today&#39;s form of licensing... like selling chips to device makers...
@noahroth anyway overall I agree with your point. Easier to make on G+ with more than 140 characters....

@noahroth @shiraabel @asoldiersmother Noah baloney the demonstrators are 1-2% of Hareidi society.  1-2% of a lot is a lot.
@noahroth Ah, OK, 80% might be close in that case, but I still think lower, many work at teaching or adminstering even if off the books
@noahroth I&#39;ve been told the best is to buy a pre-paid T-Mobile usim, but I&#39;ve never done it. To divert voice calls you need to do it here.
