It&#39;s being a suit to college day #interviewspic.twitter.com/mHYTVd8jCs
Enjoyed the mock interview today for class. Of all the subjects I&#39;ve ever performed a presentation on, myself was probably the strangest.
There&#39;s a guy standing in front of me on the bus &quot;bus surfing&quot; apparently I&#39;m not the only person in the world that does that.
Well done Jason Collins. http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/news/20130429/jason-collins-gay-nba-player/#ixzz2RrjYUqUM&nbsp;…
Google Now on iOS is good fun isn&#39;t it? Will probably be a massive drain on battery though on my old iPhone 4
Testing out self deleting tweets from efemr this goes away in sixty seconds apparently #1m
needless to say it&#39;s still a bit buggy
Last night my poor teammate broke our project for submission and presentation today, he&#39;s absolutely distraught. #DontWorry
@Adlers1 to not so subtly tell people you like them &quot;in that way&quot; no?
Interesting idea http://www.tweetbookz.com&nbsp; create a physical book of your twitter feed.

@kevinjpurcell score, thanks. I&#39;ll need all the eyes and ears I can get to find a job ASAP.
@kevinjpurcell looked up that job, nice place to start out fresh outta college. I&#39;ll be applying tonight.
@kevinjpurcell I noticed that but the earlier you&#39;re in the better chance of getting a base English speaking role plus my German isn&#39;t bad.
I started the day with one gaol project housing and ended the day with a completely different one. #Yikes
It&#39;s my hope that I can have one more module finished in it&#39;s entirety by the end of the day. #2toGo

@RichDsy the perverted man in the corner watching people use the &quot;new technology&quot; We&#39;ll all be there someday.

@Golden_Gaytime Thanks Wolfgang. 10 days to my Dublin move too.
@Golden_Gaytime Very. College finishes on the 17th and I move on the 18th. Scary but brilliant.
@Golden_Gaytime We should definitely catch up. No job but the boyfriend who is moving too is the new Revenue Manager for Travelodge Irl so..
@Golden_Gaytime we have a place to stay for free until we find an apartment. I&#39;m hoping to break into social media through the C.S. roles
@Golden_Gaytime Yep. WE&#39;ve been separated by his training in the UK for the last 6 months and definitely feel that it&#39;s time #CantWait
Just blew my mind by thinking &quot;The true Deadliest Catch… is the human doing the catching&quot; :P http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/deadliest-catch&nbsp;… …

@greentothebone oooooooooooh well that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing after Game of Thrones then.
@LeamCanto @rtenews Bachelor&#39;s quay is the city centre though. Anything on the central island is.
I had a dream about construction of #DoingTime last night. I&#39;m a little obsessed.

It&#39;s time for #DoingTime our final year project to move on. Transporting it to @CIT_ie now.
@kevinjpurcell what&#39;s happening with him. I&#39;ve heard other people talking about him too. Please tell me he&#39;s leaving.
@kevinjpurcell Are we all supposed to be racists now? Ah jaysus, I don&#39;t have time for racism. 2 1/2 days left.

Waking to my first day in Dublin with a dream about college. C&#39;mon brain, it&#39;s time to switch off.
So Dublin what do you have to offer today?
First day as a resident in Dublin and I&#39;m treating myself to something yummy @bobosburgers I&#39;m gonna enjoy this.
I bought a leap card so I&#39;m pretty much a Dub now #BleedinDeadly
Gonna attempt to have a stress free day today. I&#39;ve been going non stop since.... Well January actually.

@RichDsy Hehe, everything is quite nearby. Only problem I had was being asked &quot;are you gay&quot; on the way home from ikea with Jānis last night.
Someone really should start tweeting under #ApartmentFairy it&#39;s impossible to get a place in Dublin.
@RichDsy Nope, with a bit of luck that&#39;s the plan for tonight though. We just took the bus back from Finglas and it ends there.
One apartment viewing ahead of us today. Just one. Looking for a place here is a full time job in itself.
@kevinjpurcell that @AnnCoulter tweet is a weird one. His political leanings and religion are much more important than skin colour.
@kevinjpurcell oh yeah, I know that after all you know when @piersmorgan calls @AnnCoulter a publicity leech there is a problem. Would...
@kevinjpurcell have expected her to focus on the usual hot button topics or religion or politics though. See what @LennoxLewis said?
Looking for a place to live, a job and updating my website at the same time. That&#39;s multitasking.

I&#39;ve been next on the queue for 30mins already. This is stretching my patience a lil but.
@Golden_Gaytime ah it&#39;s alright so far. Getting a place (and a job) is a pain but I&#39;m actually down in cork now for Thursday&#39;s exhibition.
12 months later I&#39;m still dealing with an ex manager who didn&#39;t give me a p45.
My mother was very impressed my project for @FullSpectrum13 was mentioned in @TheCorkNews
Now officially JiveCork on Snapchat. I&#39;d better see what everyone is talking about.
Right then Star Trek in bed it is. Staying with the parents for a few days is extremely boring.

Traveling to Dublin on an @Aircoach without air conditioning or windows #baked should have went with gobé
It just felt so good to turn down a letting agent who tried to get one over on us. Balance of power restored.
Hoping the guys at @awty2013 are having a great time. The people from @FullSpectrum13 send you all the best. #ortloike
Leaving the folks at Travelodge Ballymun to move into the new place. Seriously in need of unpacking.

Waking up for the first time in the new apartment. Still getting used to the mattress. Place is lookin good though.
@Golden_Gaytime Top of Glasnevin bottom of Finglas. Very nice apartment, top floor too so it has a great view.

Getting bills and finances sorted today. Who knew there was so much paperwork in moving house?
@beccanoonan I&#39;m at it&#39;s counterpart in Finglas now. Great pictures coming from you all in the states I&#39;m crazy jealous.
Ben Dunne gyms. Worth the bus trip from Finglas for the cheaper price or not? #Dublin
So this @irishexaminer Limerick billboard that&#39;s gotten everyone up in arms is a bit silly. Bad idea to put it outside Limerick station too.
@blueswannabe I spotted the Finglas leisure centre alright, its a fair walk from me but could be worth it. Are you local too?
@RichDsy
@RichDsy Indeed you could. You&#39;re pretty much the reason I&#39;ll rent for life.
@blueswannabe Prospect Hill the border between Finglas and Glasnevin. The hunt goes well, I have a Skype interview with a US startup 2mor.
. @bobosburgers It&#39;s almost worth the bus into town on this glorious day.
Fire alarm at the apartment block, there&#39;s only one thing for it... Go out and enjoy the sun in the shared garden until it stops.
Big day planned today. I have a lot of walking around to do but it&#39;s sunny so :D
Broken leap card scanner on the bus. Free trip to town, well that&#39;s a good start to the day.
@Newberry52 Happy out. The new place is lovely, I have an interview later today the only trial is getting stuff up from Cork. I need a van.
@Newberry52 and how are you keeping in Cork?

Now that I&#39;m finally going to use the Xbox I&#39;m very happy to hear about the death of Microsoft Points.
It&#39;s all lovely that Safari is shiny and new but get to the point guys. I&#39;m switching from #WWDC to #e32013
Ok I must admit App Nap is both a great idea and clever name.
iCloud keychain, given their track record on cloud services I reserve judgement until I hear that it works. #wwdc
Maps App. How about making the maps open source instead? Fanboys would fix this thing together quite easily. #wwdc
iBook text books with high fidelity content on the mac. That&#39;s the future folks. #MakeItHappen #wwdc
Here comes the Air. All day battery life FTW #WWDC
Ship date for Xbox One is November. #e32013
Piano black finish and cylindrical display. The new Mac Pro looks weird. It may kick ass but looks cheap #wwdc
Office 365 from Apple then. iWork for iCloud, iSnooze. Where&#39;s my ios7? #wwdc
iOS FINALLY. #wwdc
I&#39;d say my iPhone 4 may either just scrape this update or is gonna be left behind. #TearsForIOS7 #WWDC
@aoifemeefa The software on the phones and iPads.
@aoifemeefa Thank gawd. :D)))))
Very flat, very nice though. It&#39;s just so...... Different. #wwdc
@aoifemeefa I really like the new look. Dammit, I&#39;m gonna have to get a 5S aren&#39;t I?
Transparency on Control Centre, that&#39;s excellent. #wwdc
New Siri sounds good but iOS in the car is really the next step. #wwdc
iTunes radio. IT LIVES #wwdc I betcha it&#39;s not in Ireland though.
ios7 on iPhone 4 and later YAY. I&#39;m delighted #wwdc
Between the excitement of WWDC and Game Of Thrones tonight I&#39;m in nerd heaven.
So, how long before iTunes Radio comes to Ireland? I&#39;m predicting one year. It could never be available from launch, could it?
@Golden_Gaytime I wouldn&#39;t mind paying for iTunes Match in that case. A cheap one off payment and replace my DRM songs too. #WhyNot
@Golden_Gaytime I love Spotify and must admit it has some thing iTunes Radio hasn&#39;t but I could live without them to save 100ish quid.
This makes me so happy RT “@JoannaStern: Confirmed: You can put Newsstand into a folder in iOS 7!!”
@Golden_Gaytime I passed your offices a few mind ago, had been at the shopping centre and was passing. Nice place.
@Golden_Gaytime Definitely next time I&#39;m up here interested in the couples memberships at Dunne&#39;s Gym.

@Golden_Gaytime Cheers. There will be celebrations :D
I should really celebrate the end of college tonight. But how?
@blueswannabe oh yes, but very rarely and I&#39;m at a wedding tomorrow and it&#39;ll be expected there. Would much prefer good food or a movie.
Xbox One is a market player. Not only have they Uturned on stuff they&#39;ve also canceled regional restrictionshttp://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update&nbsp;
And we are awake, Cork, I&#39;m heading your way.
At a wedding in Blarney, quite tired and hungry. Food will perk me up though.
Oh my god, how did nobody tell me sorbet could be THIS good.
@kevinjpurcell yep I&#39;m at a wedding in Blarney. Never had it before (not in the least bit posh) its GORGEOUS.
I&#39;m stuffed. One day I think I&#39;ll turn into a potato. Then I&#39;ll probably cannibalistically eat myself because I smell sooo good.
Being at this wedding the sudden realisation has hit me I&#39;m definitely a city boy. Farming was mentioned in the speeches.
This is one hell of a groom&#39;s speech. #LovelyGuy
Maybe it&#39;s all the sugar from the cake but I&#39;d love a bit of Crystal Swing now.
Mad traffic on the way into Dublin and its moving extremely slowly.
Such a mistake to take Michael the people&#39;s puppet out tonight. I&#39;d vote for him to win if I could. #BBUK #PeoplesPuppet

I really enjoy seeing @iainlee on #bbots he should be on the show more often though, he&#39;s great fun. @bbuk sort it out.
I just realised I haven&#39;t played all of Tomb Raider, Guardian of Light. Lets get this done. #TripBackInTime

@kevinjpurcell Indeed. A little nervous but it&#39;ll (hopefully) be fine. Meet up this week?

Interviews are always a bit exhausting but now I can relax for the evening.
@Adlers1 Weird, it looked so familiar (though I could know it from Killarney too).
Oh Silvio Berlusconi you&#39;re never gonna go to jail but at least you&#39;re banned from public office.

Good first day back at the gym, I&#39;m gonna get that dodgy knee fixed by hook or by crook.
@Newberry52 I&#39;m waiting on an email today with fingers crossed.
@robinscreech4 Mostly businesses
According to twitter&#39;s stats I&#39;m tweeting less now than at any other point in my history. Maybe it doesn&#39;t have the same attraction?
GOT THAT JOB :D
Forced myself to the gym today because I had work celebrations last night. So so difficult, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.
This would be nice in my apartment ;)pic.twitter.com/N16nPW9kzX

@garethoconnor Were you not miffed by him not living up to his ideals in the ending (trying to not give spoilers to others)?
@garethoconnor Fair point I guess, I was happy with most of the movie but (fittingly) that was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back for me.
@CROSSYFM104 Enjoyed your DJing last night at the party and you played Kiki for me. Cheers.

Two young men on the bus with bow ties, bowler hats and umbrellas (even though its not raining). You don&#39;t get that in Cork.
Oh wait, they&#39;re tourists who probably think this is genuinely Irish clothing. At least it&#39;s not a flat cap I guess.

I&#39;m wearing shorts and I&#39;m not even in the gym #IrishSummer
So I&#39;m scalded as they would say back home. A bright shade of red now but hoping to brown a bit.
Hayfever and Asthma suffers in Dublin beware. The pollen count us ridiculously high today. I&#39;m choked.
@dmndnn will be chained to my inhailer for the day I&#39;d say.
@dmndnn Hayfever wise I&#39;ve had a better than average year. Been on generic stuff from the UK chemist superdrug, £1.50 for 14.
@dmndnn I remember you saying ya were very badly effected last year too. It must be tough. The doctor can&#39;t do anything on prescription, no?

@GrabOneIE 8am to 4pm shift. It&#39;s a blessing on a sunny evening so much it offsets the crappyness of getting outta bed at 6:30.
@GrabOneIE That&#39;s one hell of a commute, counting myself lucky I live in Finglas now. You have a good evening too. Big fan of what you do.

@FromFirstToLast I&#39;m in Finglas now sin May too (which at this stage makes my twitter name a relic).
I wonder whats going on in the world today. Time to stick one earphone in and listen to the headlines on @Newstalkfm

Four desktops, One Laptop. I am the king of space management.
@kevinjpurcell No you&#39;ve dragged me away from poor @Newstalkfm now I&#39;m gonna critique everything I hear ;P Q102 at 12 it is #JudgementDay
@UlsterBank_Help Is there a problem logging in on the iPhone app? I&#39;ve been trying all morning and get a service unavailable message.

Advice needed. To buy a iPhone 5s from the states or not? I know someone going over that could get one. Please RT.
@jaybrannan I back up to iPhoto on my computer regularly but that&#39;s mostly for display purposes.
@Golden_Gaytime yikes that was a ton of detail and all I needed thanks. Let I wouldn&#39;t be bothered about for the moment anyway but...
@Golden_Gaytime I&#39;ve read that the Worldwide warranty from the US isn&#39;t. People bring a phone to apple EU told they need to bring back to US
@Golden_Gaytime It might still be worth it for me anyway. I work for a US company now with people back and forth regularly that could do it.
@Golden_Gaytime You&#39;ve been a massive help there, wow.  Are you buying one via the same route or happy with the phone you have?
@Golden_Gaytime the guys are going to NYC really soon so chances are slim that I&#39;ll get one with current stock levels but fingers crossed :)
It&#39;s Friday and it&#39;s sunny here in Dublin. Perfect start to the day.. Let&#39;s do this thing.

Tired and Emotional “@kjmarsh: Paula White pulled off last BBC show early : Radio Today AUDIO http://bit.ly/13NHsUQ&nbsp; &gt;&gt; quite some sign off”
SAturday Night Live with Kristen Wiig, I&#39;m starting the day in style.
No bus services operating in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Clare or Kerry and the Greater Dublin Area due to the bus eireann strikes action.
Interesting read “@mathewi: &quot;Back to the future: What if the &#39;mass media&#39; era was just an accident of history?&quot; http://nie.mn/10iyGh7&nbsp;”
@ryandolanmusic congrats, will listen on Monday to get me ready for Tuesday&#39;s performance #ComeOnIreland

Bus Éireann strike set to continue into tomorrow and beyondhttp://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0512/391767-bus-eireann-strike/&nbsp;…
It&#39;s always so geeky to hear Patrick Steward introducing each race on #bbcf1 I keep waiting for him to say Engage.
There are some beautiful visuals in the original Star Trek movie but it really is the most boring two hours you&#39;ll ever spend.
Affected by the Bus Éireann strike? The #liftfairy can helphttp://jrnl.to/125adu4&nbsp;
So while @robinscreech4 goes to get glue I do my my physio Sometimes I really think I am #DoingTime 4 days
@OrlaFlynnCCAD Thanks for the follow Orla. I hope you&#39;re enjoying my #fullspectrum countdown pics.
It&#39;s almost ready for #fullspectrum &quot;The Gaol Project&quot; #DoingTimepic.twitter.com/hRN9JH7Y9n
@OrlaFlynnCCAD hehe, it certainly does stand out. Enjoy, and I hope to see you at the exhibition. Don&#39;t forget to say hi.
@greentothebone oooooooooooh well that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing after Game of Thrones then.
@LeamCanto @rtenews Bachelor&#39;s quay is the city centre though. Anything on the central island is.
I had a dream about construction of #DoingTime last night. I&#39;m a little obsessed.
Rising? It&#39;s always been there “@thejournal_ie: Horrific murder fuels fears of rising homophobia in Russia http://jrnl.to/1282prF&nbsp;”
Daft Punk Random Access Memories really is great music to write final presentations to. #NowPlaying
Giovanni Giorgio sounds so much like Werner Herzog on the new Daft Punk album it&#39;s spooky.
It&#39;s time for #DoingTime our final year project to move on. Transporting it to @CIT_ie now.
@kevinjpurcell what&#39;s happening with him. I&#39;ve heard other people talking about him too. Please tell me he&#39;s leaving.
@kevinjpurcell Are we all supposed to be racists now? Ah jaysus, I don&#39;t have time for racism. 2 1/2 days left.
Heading back up to college. Lets get this thang done.
&quot;Doing Time&quot; is up and running at the @CIT_ie Multimedia symposium tonight on the top floor of the IT building from 6-8pm #DoingTime

Thanks for the follow back @WolfgangDigital I&#39;ll be keeping an eye out for any vacancies you advertise in the near future.
Let my phone at home as I was about to get on the bus as I move to Dublin. Cue movie style rush through traffic. My mother had great fun.
@Golden_Gaytime Cheers Wolfgang. We must catch up some time soon too. I&#39;ll be free a lot as I start the job search.

@bbceurovision Alan and Jānis are watching in Dublin and scoring the acts as they go, playing for a bottle of wine.
Waking to my first day in Dublin with a dream about college. C&#39;mon brain, it&#39;s time to switch off.
So Dublin what do you have to offer today?
First day as a resident in Dublin and I&#39;m treating myself to something yummy @bobosburgers I&#39;m gonna enjoy this.
I bought a leap card so I&#39;m pretty much a Dub now #BleedinDeadly
Gonna attempt to have a stress free day today. I&#39;ve been going non stop since.... Well January actually.
The world&#39;s top brands: Apple, Google, IBM, McDonalds, Coca Cola, AT&amp;T, Micosoft, Marlboro, Visa, China Mobile. Yikes I&#39;ve used 8.
@Golden_Gaytime Yep I&#39;d need too move to China or take up smoking to complete the set. Two things I&#39;m unprepared to do.

No fears here Mr Brogan (whoever you are) I walk around Ballymun alone all the time.pic.twitter.com/5d2D8ZVDa6
@RichDsy Hehe, everything is quite nearby. Only problem I had was being asked &quot;are you gay&quot; on the way home from ikea with Jānis last night.
Someone really should start tweeting under #ApartmentFairy it&#39;s impossible to get a place in Dublin.
@RichDsy Nope, with a bit of luck that&#39;s the plan for tonight though. We just took the bus back from Finglas and it ends there.
One apartment viewing ahead of us today. Just one. Looking for a place here is a full time job in itself.
@kevinjpurcell that @AnnCoulter tweet is a weird one. His political leanings and religion are much more important than skin colour.
@kevinjpurcell oh yeah, I know that after all you know when @piersmorgan calls @AnnCoulter a publicity leech there is a problem. Would...
@kevinjpurcell have expected her to focus on the usual hot button topics or religion or politics though. See what @LennoxLewis said?
Looking for a place to live, a job and updating my website at the same time. That&#39;s multitasking.
@recruitireland I&#39;ll take a peek now. Lets see what you have for someone e in Digital Media in Dublin.

Dear god there is a Penny Pushing daytime TV quiz show called Tipping Point. The wonders I&#39;ve missed being in college :p
My throat is so sore today. Much to my boyfriends happiness it&#39;s gonna be a one day vow of silence for me.

Letting agents in Dublin think you came down with the last shower if you say you&#39;re from Cork. Tried to get 200 over the asking price.
Monaco GP highlights on the BBC. Excellent.
Ok cork, I&#39;ll see you tomorrow :)
Ok Cork, I&#39;m coming down, what have ya got for me?
@dellers yuck, glad I&#39;ve brought the raincoat so.
@greentothebone it&#39;s about to start in Dublin too. I just escaped it.
@greentothebone Actually, you coming to the exhibition on Thursday Ross?
Thank goodness Jānis would never share if this is the kind of person advertising. #NeedAPlaceInDublinpic.twitter.com/50FNnZM85R
See my creation Doing Time at Full Spectrum, opening 6.30pm Thurs May 3 until June 8 at CIT Wandesford Quay Gallery http://www.citdegreeexhibitions.com&nbsp;
@greentothebone Excellent I look forward to seeing you there. I know you for a while now but we&#39;ve never actually met.
I&#39;ve been next on the queue for 30mins already. This is stretching my patience a lil but.
@Golden_Gaytime ah it&#39;s alright so far. Getting a place (and a job) is a pain but I&#39;m actually down in cork now for Thursday&#39;s exhibition.
12 months later I&#39;m still dealing with an ex manager who didn&#39;t give me a p45.
My mother was very impressed my project for @FullSpectrum13 was mentioned in @TheCorkNews
Now officially JiveCork on Snapchat. I&#39;d better see what everyone is talking about.
Right then Star Trek in bed it is. Staying with the parents for a few days is extremely boring.
Oooh I think I&#39;m through to the second round of an Online Specialist job. I say I think because the email was especially cryptic.
Interesting that RTE are honouring the requests of parents not to repeat #PrimeTime PSB at its best.http://www.thejournal.ie/rte-no-repeats-or-online-airing-of-prime-time-creche-investigation-928711-May2013/?utm_source=twitter_self&nbsp;…

@greentothebone to meet you for the 1st time too.
Had to run to catch the bus to Dublin there. Back to reality after a fabulous night at @FullSpectrum13. Bye Cork
Traveling to Dublin on an @Aircoach without air conditioning or windows #baked should have went with gobé
It just felt so good to turn down a letting agent who tried to get one over on us. Balance of power restored.
Hoping the guys at @awty2013 are having a great time. The people from @FullSpectrum13 send you all the best. #ortloike
Leaving the folks at Travelodge Ballymun to move into the new place. Seriously in need of unpacking.
@Newberry52 Thanks Derek. Say hi if you&#39;re gonna be up for #DublinPride
There&#39;s a man behind me on the bus that sounds like old Mr Brennan. I really am living in #Dublin
&quot;and nicknamed the Rebel County, since the Senate hearings last week.&quot; Not the only factual inaccuracy in this storyhttp://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-31/apple-no-ghost-in-ireland-where-cork-frets-senate-hearing-taxes.html&nbsp;…
Waking up for the first time in the new apartment. Still getting used to the mattress. Place is lookin good though.
@Golden_Gaytime Top of Glasnevin bottom of Finglas. Very nice apartment, top floor too so it has a great view.
On http://twitter.com&nbsp; you can now get tailored trends to Cork and Galway too. Time to get #Langer trending.pic.twitter.com/1Goc0XEVFw
Getting bills and finances sorted today. Who knew there was so much paperwork in moving house?
@beccanoonan I&#39;m at it&#39;s counterpart in Finglas now. Great pictures coming from you all in the states I&#39;m crazy jealous.
Ben Dunne gyms. Worth the bus trip from Finglas for the cheaper price or not? #Dublin
So this @irishexaminer Limerick billboard that&#39;s gotten everyone up in arms is a bit silly. Bad idea to put it outside Limerick station too.
@blueswannabe I spotted the Finglas leisure centre alright, its a fair walk from me but could be worth it. Are you local too?
@RichDsy
@RichDsy Indeed you could. You&#39;re pretty much the reason I&#39;ll rent for life.
@blueswannabe Prospect Hill the border between Finglas and Glasnevin. The hunt goes well, I have a Skype interview with a US startup 2mor.
. @bobosburgers It&#39;s almost worth the bus into town on this glorious day.
Fire alarm at the apartment block, there&#39;s only one thing for it... Go out and enjoy the sun in the shared garden until it stops.
Big day planned today. I have a lot of walking around to do but it&#39;s sunny so :D
Broken leap card scanner on the bus. Free trip to town, well that&#39;s a good start to the day.
@Newberry52 Happy out. The new place is lovely, I have an interview later today the only trial is getting stuff up from Cork. I need a van.
@Newberry52 and how are you keeping in Cork?
Going to take a look at the European Space Expo in @tcddublin it certainly is quite an impressive structure.pic.twitter.com/walsuwaowO

@blueswannabe it went really well actually, nice chat with lively people, fingers crossed. I just passed the IFIC area there actually.
@blueswannabe Working hard no doubt. Just found out I have another interview with a different company next week too. #ThingsArePickingUp
THAT episode of Game of Thrones will be viewed in the penthouse tonight. #NoSpoilers
Watching Teen Wolf Season 3. #GuiltyPleasure #NightOff
@mushacles Not the greatest episode to be honest a lot of glossing over the 2nd season ending.

About to enjoy a free breakfast thanks to the folks at Denny Ireland and @98FM here at their Grafton Street pop up cafe. YUM.
@Golden_Gaytime Who is it you&#39;re working with at the moment actually?
@Golden_Gaytime Lemmie know if they&#39;re hiring then :D)))) Still shopping around for a job here. Looking to earn myself some €€€.
Re-watching The Name of the Doctor while on the bus to Cork. This episode makes up for all the crappy ones this season. #Trenzelore

OSX Mavericks? MAVERICKS? So they&#39;re naming it after a Mel Gibson movie.
Now that I&#39;m finally going to use the Xbox I&#39;m very happy to hear about the death of Microsoft Points.
It&#39;s all lovely that Safari is shiny and new but get to the point guys. I&#39;m switching from #WWDC to #e32013
Ok I must admit App Nap is both a great idea and clever name.
iCloud keychain, given their track record on cloud services I reserve judgement until I hear that it works. #wwdc
Maps App. How about making the maps open source instead? Fanboys would fix this thing together quite easily. #wwdc
iBook text books with high fidelity content on the mac. That&#39;s the future folks. #MakeItHappen #wwdc
Here comes the Air. All day battery life FTW #WWDC
Ship date for Xbox One is November. #e32013
Piano black finish and cylindrical display. The new Mac Pro looks weird. It may kick ass but looks cheap #wwdc
Office 365 from Apple then. iWork for iCloud, iSnooze. Where&#39;s my ios7? #wwdc
iOS FINALLY. #wwdc
I&#39;d say my iPhone 4 may either just scrape this update or is gonna be left behind. #TearsForIOS7 #WWDC
@aoifemeefa The software on the phones and iPads.
@aoifemeefa Thank gawd. :D)))))
Very flat, very nice though. It&#39;s just so...... Different. #wwdc
@aoifemeefa I really like the new look. Dammit, I&#39;m gonna have to get a 5S aren&#39;t I?
Transparency on Control Centre, that&#39;s excellent. #wwdc
New Siri sounds good but iOS in the car is really the next step. #wwdc
iTunes radio. IT LIVES #wwdc I betcha it&#39;s not in Ireland though.
ios7 on iPhone 4 and later YAY. I&#39;m delighted #wwdc
Between the excitement of WWDC and Game Of Thrones tonight I&#39;m in nerd heaven.
So, how long before iTunes Radio comes to Ireland? I&#39;m predicting one year. It could never be available from launch, could it?
@Golden_Gaytime I wouldn&#39;t mind paying for iTunes Match in that case. A cheap one off payment and replace my DRM songs too. #WhyNot
@Golden_Gaytime I love Spotify and must admit it has some thing iTunes Radio hasn&#39;t but I could live without them to save 100ish quid.
This makes me so happy RT “@JoannaStern: Confirmed: You can put Newsstand into a folder in iOS 7!!”
@Golden_Gaytime I passed your offices a few mind ago, had been at the shopping centre and was passing. Nice place.
@Golden_Gaytime Definitely next time I&#39;m up here interested in the couples memberships at Dunne&#39;s Gym.
Watching Star Trek the Original Series on CBS Action. I must be very bored.
Yikes, I&#39;m currently watching a CNN correspondent Arwa Damon getting hit by tear gas in Istanbul. #turkey

Listening to @stephenfry on @Herring1967 Leicester Square podcast speaking about his bi-polar disorder. Such an interesting subject matter.

Nominations live. I&#39;m loving #BBUK so much right now.
@brianclayton probably HMV again. They&#39;re reopening in Dublin and Limerick too.
Beautiful day for @MichelleObama to visit Glendalough. #IrishSummer
@brianclayton That&#39;s quite a coup I haven&#39;t bought a physical CD or DVD in years but its good to see a small company expanding these days.

So, I have a degree now (Very happy).
@Golden_Gaytime Cheers. There will be celebrations :D
I should really celebrate the end of college tonight. But how?
@blueswannabe oh yes, but very rarely and I&#39;m at a wedding tomorrow and it&#39;ll be expected there. Would much prefer good food or a movie.
Xbox One is a market player. Not only have they Uturned on stuff they&#39;ve also canceled regional restrictionshttp://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update&nbsp;
And we are awake, Cork, I&#39;m heading your way.
At a wedding in Blarney, quite tired and hungry. Food will perk me up though.
Oh my god, how did nobody tell me sorbet could be THIS good.
@kevinjpurcell yep I&#39;m at a wedding in Blarney. Never had it before (not in the least bit posh) its GORGEOUS.
I&#39;m stuffed. One day I think I&#39;ll turn into a potato. Then I&#39;ll probably cannibalistically eat myself because I smell sooo good.
Being at this wedding the sudden realisation has hit me I&#39;m definitely a city boy. Farming was mentioned in the speeches.
This is one hell of a groom&#39;s speech. #LovelyGuy
Maybe it&#39;s all the sugar from the cake but I&#39;d love a bit of Crystal Swing now.
Mad traffic on the way into Dublin and its moving extremely slowly.
Such a mistake to take Michael the people&#39;s puppet out tonight. I&#39;d vote for him to win if I could. #BBUK #PeoplesPuppet
Folks looking for work, good luck. “@ConorCulkin: Mahon Point cinema and Suas bar both looking for for staff. #jobfairy”

I just realised I haven&#39;t played all of Tomb Raider, Guardian of Light. Lets get this done. #TripBackInTime
Catching up on my film review podcasts trying to figure out weather to go see #WorldWarZ or not.
The @KermodeMovie review of #ManOfSteel is so on the button it&#39;s scary.
@Adlers1 Is that in Ballymun?
Big afternoon tomorrow #FingersCrossed
@kevinjpurcell Indeed. A little nervous but it&#39;ll (hopefully) be fine. Meet up this week?
Three mobile phone network down across the country (Thank goodness I thought it was just me)http://jrnl.ie/964056&nbsp;
And we&#39;re back. The last few hours without internet were dark times. Dark, dark times :P @threecare
Interviews are always a bit exhausting but now I can relax for the evening.
@Adlers1 Weird, it looked so familiar (though I could know it from Killarney too).
Oh Silvio Berlusconi you&#39;re never gonna go to jail but at least you&#39;re banned from public office.

Not a great job on covering the situation tonight on #rtept too much navel gazing. Put on @MiriamOCal, mammy will sort it out.
&quot;Gym?&quot; &quot;Eh I suppose so.&quot; That&#39;s my inner monologue people. #nopainnogain
Good first day back at the gym, I&#39;m gonna get that dodgy knee fixed by hook or by crook.
@Newberry52 I&#39;m waiting on an email today with fingers crossed.
@robinscreech4 Mostly businesses
According to twitter&#39;s stats I&#39;m tweeting less now than at any other point in my history. Maybe it doesn&#39;t have the same attraction?
GOT THAT JOB :D
Forced myself to the gym today because I had work celebrations last night. So so difficult, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.
This would be nice in my apartment ;)pic.twitter.com/N16nPW9kzX
Passing by Rte News nonchalantly as they film a piece to camera. This is the real reason I moved to Dublin.
@garethoconnor Were you not miffed by him not living up to his ideals in the ending (trying to not give spoilers to others)?
@garethoconnor Fair point I guess, I was happy with most of the movie but (fittingly) that was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back for me.
@CROSSYFM104 Enjoyed your DJing last night at the party and you played Kiki for me. Cheers.
Louis should stay out. There&#39;s no way he can win and theres no reason to wreck the car. #f1 #BritishGP
