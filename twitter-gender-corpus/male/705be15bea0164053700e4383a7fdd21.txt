@woodyevans @leashless the &quot;war on terror&quot; was always a chimera.  No enemy to negotiate with, so no real war.  Smoke and mirrors

@sclopit It is a question of models. Is our model of food accurate enough to provide high quality sustenance? So far according 2 Pollan no
@sclopit Also food plays a major social and cultural role (as an Italian you will know) - what will replace that in a  food printing world?
@sclopit So yes to identifiers on/around food, pace the challenges of legibility, no to printing of food

@leashless @dougald Doomed: I think this is exactly the emotion early Puritans felt and so set off to find new lands
@leashless @dougald @cstross Steady state may be boring, but has been workable in the past and will be again cf. @Feeding9Billion
@leashless @dougald @cstross @Feeding9Billion We have not always had frontiers to expand into. Repeated civilisations have collapsed
@leashless @dougald @cstross @Feeding9Billion In some parts of the world, there have been steady states (Bali, Australia), so not impossible
@leashless the cold out there is really biting. Sounds like a bad idea.  Come to Brum instead

@tiggr93 @leashless in the UK it is mostly much cheaper to live in towns. London is the exception. Try living in countryside in the 1\2
@tiggr93 @leashless London - Bristol-Birmingham triangle. Houses cost double in countryside
@tiggr93 @leashless however in most countries it is true it is cheaper to live in countryside. Simple: no jobs

@tommyh What event are you referring to?
@joguldi yes of course. Just had to buy another hb copy.  Need to buy at least one more soon.  Paperback would be welcome
@joguldi not so far (I work in a business school). Copies went to friends :-)
@leashless Most people use a framework which hides most of the AJAX stuff e.g. Node.js + Express
@leashless @nkoren agreed. That is the nature of infrastructure. You win something, you lose something. Must be a #golang equivalent
@leashless 55% &quot;everything know moderation including moderation&quot;- makes me sound very boring #psychopathnight
@leashless @dougald @bjorkmananna Ronnie says I just have a veneer of politeness underneath I am as bad as @leashless
Ronnie says she is proud to know a psychopath in @leashless
@leashless standard practice.  Trouble is I never know exactly what I am allowed to do
@leashless thanks.  I have always confused the two categories
@leashless which of the two is GoldmanSachs selecting for? Remember the article?
@leashless this is a constant problem across CS and AI
@nkoren @leashless @dougald @bjorkmananna @nickstew_art @smarimc no we will just avoid getting you to lead in a crisis or start a war
@leashless @nkoren how much time are you allowing for &quot;understanding completely&quot; hours? Days? Weeks?
@nkoren @leashless now I understand why they have these weird callback functions in JS. I never learnt LISP....
@lucasgonzalez can you point me to the papers on this? Thanks
@lucasgonzalez I know relatively little about permaculture but I need to write about it over Xmas hence questions
