@Eil82 @LukaBassin I believe in your project and you have my full support man! Looking forward for your stuff!!!
IMO Begic is being a big pain in the ass for Maccabi all along the series. Are they too focused on him? @sJacas
@dejangod @sjacas Agree. + forcing them to double team in low post every time he gets the ball
@robscott33 Begic is posting up today...
IMO Pascual is making a huge effort to bring Lorbek back to earth. Not many coaches would. I like it.
of course he can do it because Lorbek has a lot of well deserved credit from past seasons. Earned credit.
@rodhig7 Maybe. But we&#39;ll read your live blogging during Athens game&#39;s halftime.
Agree! &quot;Reyes spent a couple of minutes during the 2nd 4er laughing at the whole concept of stretch four&quot; by @rodhig7 http://www.in-the-game.org/?p=22864&nbsp;
@sannti @robscott33 Azerbajanish airlines? WOW

@TikotDeRoa Ya. Ha habido cruce...
@rodhig7 @robscott33 @pistolpete_osfp @rafael_uehara @DONbblog @sJacas OK just followed those of you I wasn&#39;t following. We&#39;ll have fun
FCB&#39;s zone is really serious stuff... Not easy to beat
“@robscott33: you get the feeling PAO really, really need those corner 3s to drop” or they&#39;ll struggle big time
FCB&#39;s three guys switching action on P&amp;R defense keeps working. Defensive Execution close to perfection
@sannti There are zones and Zones... I&#39;d say this is one of the latters. Activity, big guys moving their feet... Not many off rebs...
FCB is closing 3rd 4er with Sada at the PF and Lorbek at SF
@georgerowland @sannti Agree
@DONbblog @robscott33 @pistolpete_osfp @rodhig7 @rafael_uehara @sjacas And giving (more and more) confidence to Lorbek
@DONbblog @robscott33 @pistolpete_osfp @rodhig7 @rafael_uehara @sjacas Hell yeah
I have an hypothesis, CSKA give more passes per game (not assists) than any other team in TOP 16. I wonder what @sJacas and the guys think
Please @rodhig7 @DONbblog @pistolpete_osfp @rafael_uehara check my last tweet and let me know what you think...

@tomasvds Feeling the pressure? We&#39;ll be watching! Have a good game!
@robscott33 @euro_adventures Banks for a chair #justkidding
@robscott33 @euro_adventures That would only help PAO though #stillkidding
3 fouls in first not the same as 3 fouls in third so... We&#39;ve got game
“@rodhig7: 2nd 4er recap http://www.in-the-game.org/?p=22864&nbsp; I hope it remains close, I don&#39;t want to tweet about Pique and Shakira.”Hope u don&#39;t have to
A small player cutting baseline to the short corner is a good option vs. zone. Messina started doing it years ago with Papaloukas in CSKA
@sJacas Is the ball screen towards baseline working better than towards the middle for PAO or is it just my imagination?
@sJacas I&#39;ll take a look at it anyway. Some better looks but again I&#39;m not 100% sure
P&amp;R con V-Span, ajustes a zonas Mahmuti,parejas interiores diversas (Hines-Antic-Sermadini-Printezis / Barac-Erden-Savanovic-Gonlum) Farmar!
@Blue_LB Oly o Efes
@sJacas I really really really need to know if V-Span was injured and that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t play the last minutes - seconds! of G4 (really)
Let&#39;s see. My colleague @brianmccormick needs to know: Is there a reliable source for injury data for the top european leagues?
Sometimes with players it is like the slower the shooter&#39;s release (Printezis e.g.) the slower the defender&#39;s close out.
Spanoulis Sada-ing Shipp
Best minutes for EFES offense so far in the playoffs... Finding so many wide open shots, they aren&#39;t even taking all of them...
“@sannti: Tunçeri brought a different dimension to Efes offense. 3 assists...forcing the defense into tough situations.” Old School PG!
@sannti LOL
@sannti Not left! Right! Right!
@Euro_Adventures Star Wars Imperial March music, lasers... Frightening isn&#39;t it?
Hines guarding Erden is quite something... http://rjmbasket-english.blogspot.com.es/2013/04/balance-kyle-hines.html&nbsp;…
@Gus_bball @Eurohopes They had a private scrimmage for those scouts without tickets for today&#39;s game. LOL
@sannti Maybe not LOL
@sannti You can say you were talking about 80 minutes
@Gus_bball He is the kind of player every coach loves. O &amp; D. Continuous effort. Unselfish.
@Justin_Ingram20 Yes you are. I know the reason is you&#39;re focused on your team though. #1moreforthefinals
@Justin_Ingram20 actually: “@CoachFinamore: OT in Boston. Carmelo is 9-31 from field. 14-18 FT 6 rebounds. 2 assists 7 turnovers”
C&#39;s giving Terry the ball because he is, you know, O-N-F-I-R-E

@CoachFinamore #foulordefend alarm in Spanish ACB. Obradoiro-Unicaja. Seems like Unicaja will defend

@sJacas Is it sunny outside or what are those londoners doing man?
@sJacas LOL #bigfans
Spanoulis loves to &quot;reject&quot; ballscreens, specially on transition, Jackson should be aware...
Weems&#39; D on V-Span is no joke... CSKA&#39;s use of high post (not only with big men) just amazing. Guess you all know about Hines&#39; balance...
CSKA&#39;s notpickbutslip situation for Jackson&#39;s three... By now the best way to avoid OLY&#39;s hedging @BasketEditorpic.twitter.com/smetzhe16U
@Gus_bball Agree... If I&#39;m not wrong they did it only once during the first half...
This OLY&#39;s set is great for V-Span, Sloukas should be more patient if he plays the 2 role. @BasketEditorpic.twitter.com/KKIybeKL2A
Definitly ball screen is not the way for CSKA today. Not even if they mix it with hand offs or any other situation...
So, no post up and no pick&amp;roll/pop... tough game for CSKA
@CoachPerkins @robscott33 Vorontsevich&#39;s was their 2nd FG in 2nd half. Yes. Beyond scary.
@wardjdim @HoopLikeDrazen You know if it ain&#39;t broken why should u change it?
Kyle who? Too small for what? http://www.rjmbasket.blogspot.com.es/2013/04/equilibrio-kyle-hines.html&nbsp;… #devotion #notyourheightbutyourheart (and more)
Watch FCB&#39;s mismatch D... Double team and ready to rotate.
Will RMA change their mid ball screen D vs Marcelinho? Or will they expect him to start missing those mid range J&#39;s? Interesting
I believe in @sJacas lineups. You should too: http://www.in-the-game.org/stats.php?team=Real%20Madrid&amp;level=team&amp;sub=lineup&amp;stage=all&nbsp;…
Not the first time Laso draws that set to finish a quarter. Nice execution and wide open shot from the corner.
How is Jawai going to defend ball screens? Help? Defend at all? We&#39;ll see. Interesting.
@sJacas Indeed!
@rafael_uehara There was one really painful, the one Wallace missed and was followed by Reyes&#39; and1. It was a 6 points play.
@robscott33 I&#39;ll be watching them live this week during the Spanish championship... Obviously they&#39;re favourite to win it...
@robscott33 You saw them beat Barça... RMA has some good players, Sevilla is a good team... As the tournament goes on I&#39;ll let you know
Real&#39;s weak side activity is working...Plus Llull intensity on Spanoulis... Plus Begic...  Oly 7 points in 7 minutes, WOW
@robscott33 Agree, if they let him shoot that easily he&#39;ll end up hitting a couple of daggers and...
Notice that Serrod, today, is a much better p&amp;r player than Teodosic, much harder to stop him...
@HoopLikeDrazen @sJacas Guess this was the situation, am I right?pic.twitter.com/GuJtKzNzS4
Slaughter has been underrated all season long. All that intensity... They knew well what they were signing last summer
@robscott33 It´s not a joke. Not the first time I see it
@brianmccormick Don´t know if you&#39;re being ironic pal... Anyway, the answer is yes
Nice RS,very good Top16,amazing playoffs,awsome F4. Finally the best team won.Respect for OLY, well deserved. RMA will fight 4 it again soon
@robscott33 First Joventut&#39;s game in Spanish Championship was easy. Next two appear to be to cool down after NIJT. We&#39;ll see in top 16 - 8
@robscott33 Spanish U18 championship SF Barça-Cornella (tournament underdogs) and Joventut-Real M. (RMA beat Unicaja in QF)
@robscott33 He scored 48 yesterday in QF against Estudiantes. Amazing performance

@rafael_uehara @robscott33 IMO he&#39;s far from being a better fit than Huertas!
@robscott33 @rafael_uehara I guess you&#39;re right. IMO it won&#39;t be easy to find a better option though. I&#39;d be really cautious
@DjordjevicStef @robscott33 @rafael_uehara I&#39;d like to know what do they think in Barcelona.
@rafael_uehara @robscott33 I have to agree again. IMHO Dusko&#39;s &quot;go to the basket&quot; style in Vitoria was quite different than Barça&#39;s way
@rafael_uehara Check your cellphone, don&#39;t risk malfunctioning... Is the signal ok? sure?
@davidgomezm89 Muchas gracias, lo leeré - veré detenidamente.
@GreenHoopsLt Thank you very much. We worked on it during the season, so it&#39;s first hand stuff. Again, I appreciate the feedback.
@GreenHoopsLt I want to push the ball,sometimes through passes (hopefully) but if there&#39;s no pass, why not dribbling if you have the skills?
@GreenHoopsLt First run (pass or dribble) then, if there&#39;s no option to finish in 4-6 seconds, we&#39;ll see what to do...
@GreenHoopsLt &quot;depending on situation&quot; That&#39;s the key. React to the situation trying to follow your phylosophy. Mine is: push the ball...
@GreenHoopsLt ...and we&#39;ll stop later if we have to
@GreenHoopsLt Well, I like to have clear rules (without them, there&#39;s no way to play) but words like &quot;allways&quot; or &quot;never&quot;... are dangerous
@monchofdez Qué te parece el close out de Draper...
I was missing @sJacas lineups. RMA to finish the game with Rodríguez, Llull, Rudy, Mirotic, Reyes
@SportandoBasket They were resourceful :-)
@sannti Million dollar question... I think Barça will give up anything but Carroll if you know what I mean...
@sannti Isolate off ball screens to avoid easy switching? Mirotic on the opposite corner to punish rotation with the kick out pass?
@sannti It won&#39;t be easy, they&#39;ve (FCB) been working on this since the Copa del Rey... I&#39;m excited to watch how Real is going to fix it
@sannti Agree. Just like here and we&#39;ll see if FCB bigs can rotate! Again, I think it is a key issue in the finalspic.twitter.com/N19Zup1kh2
@sannti Agree! Just like the old song: http://www.songsforteaching.com/folk/dembones.php&nbsp;… Mirotic connected to Carroll, who is connected to Sergio, who is... Synergies!

@HoopLikeDrazen Keep an eye on Fran Guerra (&#39;92)
@HoopLikeDrazen I think he will. Saw him a week ago and he was better than I expected… It will be interesting to follow his development
@rafael_uehara As you said, his performance was great at FIBA Americas… No European team giving him a try?
@rafael_uehara He appeared to be under control all along the FIBA Americas… Understandable though.
It&#39;s early, but Banvit looked good against EFES… It is a team to follow for many reasons this season, isn&#39;t it?pic.twitter.com/Liubo2OBlD

@HoopLikeDrazen Some would send the big guy to the bench for allowing a shot instead of forcing the penetration
Third game I watch Banvit so far this season (and pre-season)and  it&#39;s clear they want to be aggressive when defending ball screens
@brianmccormick @GalenHarkness @harrimannonen It varies a lot depending on level. I&#39;d say it goes from around 30 to maybe 50-60 (top teams)
@brianmccormick @GalenHarkness Agree with more games=better development but too many games + not enough practice wouldn&#39;t work... Balance
@GalenHarkness @harrimannonen @brianmccormick BTW in Hungary there&#39;s the U23 league (with many U18 players) with 22 RS games + F8...

@rafael_uehara Agree
You&#39;re so picky :-D “@brianmccormick: Looking at YouTube: throwing the ball off the glass and jumping to get it is not a &quot;rebounding drill&quot;
@rafael_uehara To me it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s getting stronger. And faster. And I&#39;d say he keeps working on his skills. Looks really good
RT: &quot;@rafael_uehara: I think what might determine how soon he becomes a contriutor at NBA level is his level of readiness on defense. (2)”

“@sJacas: I&#39;d assume a little less: there&#39;s ca. 20 orb/game in average,4 of them converted for direct putbacks.Maybe 12-14?” Sounds accurate

@rafael_uehara + he can shoot. He&#39;s living a second youth, better than the first one IMHO
@Justin_Ingram20 Are you skipping practices or what?
If you&#39;re going to follow @Euroleague this season, you can celebrate its tip off with @sJacas and his charts: WHERE ADVANCED STATS HAPPEN
Jelinek reads well the 2 vs. 1 in fastbreak situation and finishes straight instead of giving the useless pass many players give so often
@quiquevich @jondelapresa Some would say he needs to gain weight I think he needs to improve his balance to use his strenght properly
@quiquevich @jondelapresa But clearly he is on his way to be if not the best one of the best inside players in Europe
Corner threes in LBO-MAC... Danger!
As Mirotic gets better and better, RMA bigs get harder to defend. Plus defensive solidness (without Mejri!)... they look real good again

@agustijulbe @sJacas Against that FCB you had to dunk or hit &quot;nothing but net&quot; or you wouldn&#39;t score at all. Right players+practice I guess
@sJacas Does he wear yellow jersey?

@rafael_uehara And to answer your question, cam &amp; mics are not that annoying. Everyone is used to them, c&#39;mon!
100% agree RT @sJacas: RMB &amp; Fener don&#39;t just stretch the defense to the 3pt arc, but often to NBA 3pt distance.
.@sJacas Maybe teams could try giving up the mid-range shots... Bulls style... Not easy anyway
I&#39;d like them to answer but I guess their answer would be &quot;not likely&quot; @sJacas We need FG% data for 0-8&quot; 8-16&quot; 16-24&quot; shotclock periods

@RomainDsDz My point is, what&#39;s its use if you can&#39;t shoot off that hand off pass? Spanoulis and Bogdanovic can.
@RomainDsDz That&#39;s it. Of course, there will be a repick right after the hand off, but then, that&#39;s a different story.

A small player cutting baseline to the short corner is a good option vs. zone. Messina started doing it years ago with Papaloukas in CSKA
@sJacas Is the ball screen towards baseline working better than towards the middle for PAO or is it just my imagination?
@sJacas I&#39;ll take a look at it anyway. Some better looks but again I&#39;m not 100% sure
P&amp;R con V-Span, ajustes a zonas Mahmuti,parejas interiores diversas (Hines-Antic-Sermadini-Printezis / Barac-Erden-Savanovic-Gonlum) Farmar!
@Blue_LB Oly o Efes
@sJacas I really really really need to know if V-Span was injured and that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t play the last minutes - seconds! of G4 (really)
Let&#39;s see. My colleague @brianmccormick needs to know: Is there a reliable source for injury data for the top european leagues?
Sometimes with players it is like the slower the shooter&#39;s release (Printezis e.g.) the slower the defender&#39;s close out.
Spanoulis Sada-ing Shipp
Best minutes for EFES offense so far in the playoffs... Finding so many wide open shots, they aren&#39;t even taking all of them...

So, no post up and no pick&amp;roll/pop... tough game for CSKA
@CoachPerkins @robscott33 Vorontsevich&#39;s was their 2nd FG in 2nd half. Yes. Beyond scary.

Will RMA change their mid ball screen D vs Marcelinho? Or will they expect him to start missing those mid range J&#39;s? Interesting
I believe in @sJacas lineups. You should too: http://www.in-the-game.org/stats.php?team=Real%20Madrid&amp;level=team&amp;sub=lineup&amp;stage=all&nbsp;…
Not the first time Laso draws that set to finish a quarter. Nice execution and wide open shot from the corner.
How is Jawai going to defend ball screens? Help? Defend at all? We&#39;ll see. Interesting.
@sJacas Indeed!

@rafael_uehara @robscott33 IMO he&#39;s far from being a better fit than Huertas!
@robscott33 @rafael_uehara I guess you&#39;re right. IMO it won&#39;t be easy to find a better option though. I&#39;d be really cautious
@DjordjevicStef @robscott33 @rafael_uehara I&#39;d like to know what do they think in Barcelona.
@rafael_uehara @robscott33 I have to agree again. IMHO Dusko&#39;s &quot;go to the basket&quot; style in Vitoria was quite different than Barça&#39;s way
@rafael_uehara Check your cellphone, don&#39;t risk malfunctioning... Is the signal ok? sure?
@davidgomezm89 Muchas gracias, lo leeré - veré detenidamente.
@GreenHoopsLt Thank you very much. We worked on it during the season, so it&#39;s first hand stuff. Again, I appreciate the feedback.
@GreenHoopsLt I want to push the ball,sometimes through passes (hopefully) but if there&#39;s no pass, why not dribbling if you have the skills?
@GreenHoopsLt First run (pass or dribble) then, if there&#39;s no option to finish in 4-6 seconds, we&#39;ll see what to do...
@GreenHoopsLt &quot;depending on situation&quot; That&#39;s the key. React to the situation trying to follow your phylosophy. Mine is: push the ball...
@GreenHoopsLt ...and we&#39;ll stop later if we have to
@GreenHoopsLt Well, I like to have clear rules (without them, there&#39;s no way to play) but words like &quot;allways&quot; or &quot;never&quot;... are dangerous
@monchofdez Qué te parece el close out de Draper...
I was missing @sJacas lineups. RMA to finish the game with Rodríguez, Llull, Rudy, Mirotic, Reyes
@SportandoBasket They were resourceful :-)
@sannti Million dollar question... I think Barça will give up anything but Carroll if you know what I mean...
@sannti Isolate off ball screens to avoid easy switching? Mirotic on the opposite corner to punish rotation with the kick out pass?
@sannti It won&#39;t be easy, they&#39;ve (FCB) been working on this since the Copa del Rey... I&#39;m excited to watch how Real is going to fix it
@sannti Agree. Just like here and we&#39;ll see if FCB bigs can rotate! Again, I think it is a key issue in the finalspic.twitter.com/N19Zup1kh2
@sannti Agree! Just like the old song: http://www.songsforteaching.com/folk/dembones.php&nbsp;… Mirotic connected to Carroll, who is connected to Sergio, who is... Synergies!

Van Gundy &quot;You can forget sometimes just how good Wade is&quot; (ya se encarga el de recordártelo, Coach)

@HoopLikeDrazen Keep an eye on Fran Guerra (&#39;92)
@HoopLikeDrazen I think he will. Saw him a week ago and he was better than I expected… It will be interesting to follow his development
@rafael_uehara As you said, his performance was great at FIBA Americas… No European team giving him a try?
@rafael_uehara He appeared to be under control all along the FIBA Americas… Understandable though.
It&#39;s early, but Banvit looked good against EFES… It is a team to follow for many reasons this season, isn&#39;t it?pic.twitter.com/Liubo2OBlD

@HoopLikeDrazen Some would send the big guy to the bench for allowing a shot instead of forcing the penetration
Third game I watch Banvit so far this season (and pre-season)and  it&#39;s clear they want to be aggressive when defending ball screens
@brianmccormick @GalenHarkness @harrimannonen It varies a lot depending on level. I&#39;d say it goes from around 30 to maybe 50-60 (top teams)
@brianmccormick @GalenHarkness Agree with more games=better development but too many games + not enough practice wouldn&#39;t work... Balance

@sJacas IMO Slaughter has been one of RMA&#39;s best signings in years.
@rafael_uehara Do u think it could be a balance thing more than a weight thing? I mean,he will never be a J.Dorsey if u know what I mean
@rafael_uehara Agree
You&#39;re so picky :-D “@brianmccormick: Looking at YouTube: throwing the ball off the glass and jumping to get it is not a &quot;rebounding drill&quot;
@rafael_uehara To me it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s getting stronger. And faster. And I&#39;d say he keeps working on his skills. Looks really good
RT: &quot;@rafael_uehara: I think what might determine how soon he becomes a contriutor at NBA level is his level of readiness on defense. (2)”

Jelinek reads well the 2 vs. 1 in fastbreak situation and finishes straight instead of giving the useless pass many players give so often

Corner threes in LBO-MAC... Danger!

100% agree RT @sJacas: RMB &amp; Fener don&#39;t just stretch the defense to the 3pt arc, but often to NBA 3pt distance.
.@sJacas Maybe teams could try giving up the mid-range shots... Bulls style... Not easy anyway
I&#39;d like them to answer but I guess their answer would be &quot;not likely&quot; @sJacas We need FG% data for 0-8&quot; 8-16&quot; 16-24&quot; shotclock periods

Great player &amp; hard worker RT @BBLofficial: ICYMI Paul Gause headlines our Team of the Week this week #BBLCupFinal!pic.twitter.com/9D6rtNjvUh
Real Quick: Liberar Tiros - Kyle Hines http://bit.ly/1dKnG0E&nbsp;
@nandoblanco It&#39;s all about reward / risk. At least at the highest level. Also, I guess the work (or lack of) with youngsters is important
And you&#39;d think, &quot;another easy W for RMA&quot; but it wasn&#39;t! Which is still more amazing.
Ball screen defense KEY: arms &amp; hands actionpic.twitter.com/h3KbOSXHm2
One of the best game endings I&#39;ve watched in a while... Those three sideline inboundings in a row, plus the coast to coast... #devotion
MPS sideline OOB set. They did it twice to play the hand off with Hackett... #BasketEditorpic.twitter.com/EBClZuryCh
...and the third time, Hunter with the backdoor cut to score! #BasketEditorpic.twitter.com/OSIuIyGcjA
@LithuaniaBasket Funny how some players like that kind of talking.
@LithuaniaBasket IMHO everyone has his share of responsibility when things go wrong.He takes it from his shoulders to put it on someone else
@LithuaniaBasket I think you get my point. It&#39;s his opinion, OK. I still think no one should avoid responsibility.And to me,smells like that
Ever noticed Draper&#39;s screens quality? Nice thing for a small player to set good screens
V-Span show has started… again #devotionpic.twitter.com/inndVTEdTU
Not many teams can make proper use of this hand off situation. OLY and FBU can.pic.twitter.com/it9KqkK9mD
@gonzalobedia IMO passer-receiver coord. Plus pass technique (hands position, body position, ball protection) plus pass angle...
@RomainDsDz My point is, what&#39;s its use if you can&#39;t shoot off that hand off pass? Spanoulis and Bogdanovic can.
@RomainDsDz That&#39;s it. Of course, there will be a repick right after the hand off, but then, that&#39;s a different story.
V-Span and mismatch decision making. Stay tunned...
Defensa De Desajuste / Mismatch Defense http://rjmbasket.blogspot.com.es/2014/01/defensa-de-desajuste-ideas-basicas.html#.UsfVG0REOxM.twitter&nbsp;…
@georgerowland Coach Plaza keeps doing it in Malaga. They do it on a regular basis+specially against that kind of player (see vs. Navarro)
Agree @robscott33 @luis_cristovao Team defense. You need good organization or it will be wide open shot after wide open shot
Yes @luis_cristovao @robscott33 the main idea (for me) is to force him to drive to the basket. That&#39;s the first goal for the defense
