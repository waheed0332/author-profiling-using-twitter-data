@diazf_y Sorry, I&#39;m being dim, comment on what?
@diazf_y I get you. The commercial focus on high quality evaluation pushes search engines to innovate in ways academia hasn&#39;t thought of

@jteevan @sigirf if the measure tells you something different, then maybe. That wasn&#39;t covered much in the talk #sigir2012
#sigir2012 enjoyed Ryen White&#39;s log analysis talk about extracting valuable data from health queries.

@jteevan about proprietary data? To be honest I don&#39;t know.

#sigir2012 geography to the rescue of search? Apparently yes, according to our current exploratory search speaker.
#sigir2012 @BHecht really cool spatial visualisation of search results: maps, periodic tables, where senators sit in congress.
#SIGIR2012 Marc Bron tackling the difficult subject of how to evaluate exploratory search. Great session.
@jteevan @sigirf That&#39;s a critical point as far as I&#39;m concerned, there are loads of examples of science conducted on unsharable data.
#sigir2012 if I&#39;m a doctor who publishes a patient drug study, it&#39;s crazy for others to demand access to my patients, yet this is science.

@lintool Thanks; ignoring all proxy judgments (i.e. impact) &amp; re-assessing work from 1st principles has its own problems though.
@lintool Touche :) If one insisted on only judging by reading papers it might be hard for a faculty to take on people in new areas.

Goodbye winter, off to sunny Tokyo to attend, #ntcir10, #evia2013 and then #assia2013
Hard core IR evaluation nerditry at #evia2013... Tetsuya Sakai speaking about the lack of reusability of diversity test collections.
@tetsuyasakai shows condensed retrieval rank measures (ignore unjudged) seem more accurate, than conventional raw list measures #evia2013
Charlie Clarke: approximate graded relevance judgements with aggregated multiple binary nugget judgements #evia2013
Getting qrels cheaply by splitting topic into sub-topics &amp; merging search results. Sounds a bit like trels from an old CIKM paper #evia2013
@arjenpdevries @ian_soboroff can you remember? I think they were merging sets, or was it some sort of ranked list merging?
Hideo Joho giving #ntcir10 overview. Glad to see chronological evaluation run this time: measuring improvements over previous NTCIRs.
Key message from the Google keynote at #ntcir10: eliminate the SERP.

#assia2013 I&#39;m learning here too: @iadh saying that Bill Cooper (not Robertson) was the first to propose the probability ranking principle.
#assia2013 Nice overview of retrieval models from @iadh, he really knows his stuff.
#assia2013 Doug Oard, telling us that Chinese is the best language to do IR in: little or no morphology.
#assia2013 @fdiaz_msr web search engines estimate the probability of relevance, given a query, a document, and user feedback.
#assia2013 @fdiaz_msr: when gathering relevant judgements vary the ways retrieved documents are shown to assessors
#assia2013 @fdiaz_msr: showing how web crawling responds to breaking new stories by gathering web content from social media
#assia2013 Doug Oard very entertainingly teaching us about the incredible challenges of search in E-Discovery

@fdiaz_msr All joking aside your web search talk at #assia2013 was the best presentation there.
A paper took &gt;18 months to be accepted by my journal (cue complaints), thing is 11 of those months the journal waited for author revisions
@ian_soboroff 2 review rounds + 3 revisions = 18. When people say the journal process is slow, remember it might not be due to reviewers
@gingdottwit sorry no clues.

@rainingman1 You can tell Turnitin to ignore individual documents to prevent that from being a problem.
@rainingman1 Yes, Turnitin tells you have 100% match on the earlier document, but you can tell it to ignore that doc and re-calculate

Great talk this evening by Kenneth O. Stanley from Florida on novelty search in AI applications, really cool work.
@jteevan @sigirf if the measure tells you something different, then maybe. That wasn&#39;t covered much in the talk #sigir2012
#sigir2012 enjoyed Ryen White&#39;s log analysis talk about extracting valuable data from health queries.
#sigir2012 thinking about Tue&#39;s proprietary data panel session, note all of this year&#39;s log analysis papers are from search engine groups.
@jteevan about proprietary data? To be honest I don&#39;t know.
#sigir2012 enjoyed listening about ranking features that are good for mobile local search http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/163550/fp121-lv.pdf&nbsp;…

#sigir2012 geography to the rescue of search? Apparently yes, according to our current exploratory search speaker.
#sigir2012 @BHecht really cool spatial visualisation of search results: maps, periodic tables, where senators sit in congress.
#SIGIR2012 Marc Bron tackling the difficult subject of how to evaluate exploratory search. Great session.
@jteevan @sigirf That&#39;s a critical point as far as I&#39;m concerned, there are loads of examples of science conducted on unsharable data.
#sigir2012 if I&#39;m a doctor who publishes a patient drug study, it&#39;s crazy for others to demand access to my patients, yet this is science.
#sigir2012 it only took Ricardo 3 minutes to mention wine :)
#sigir2012 I see a consensus emerging here.

@dirkahlers @HCIR_GeneG All the papers have a &quot;J Wang&quot; as an author, just not him. Maybe Google doesn&#39;t check that carefully?
@dirkahlers @HCIR_GeneG Maybe you can overwrite the suggested papers and add extra to the list, keep adding and you move ever up.
@dirkahlers @HCIR_GeneG The labels are all self-nominated. Google gave up on that idea for the Web years ago, too susceptible to spam.
