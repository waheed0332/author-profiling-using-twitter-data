Hypocrite Harry Reid accused GOP of slowing down ObamaCare, now wants to stop work for fundraiser in New Orleans after bribing Mary Landrieu

Last-ditch effort to save ObamaCare, Obama said that if reform measures consuming Congress doesn’t pass the government will go bankrupt.

Dems looking to finalize ObamaCare takeover behind closed doors. No transparency common. Waived transparency rules 2dozen times in 2009.

New MDOR: Despite $787 billion stimulus passed by Dems, labor continues to bleed. Lost 85,000 jobs in December. Real unemploy at 17.3%

Strikes me as funny Gillibrand would say Ford is out-of-step with NY. She&#39;s the one that gives new definition to term &quot;flip-flop.&quot;
Besides, Ford know&#39;s NY well. He had a &quot;fancy&quot; fundraiser in NYC with Bill Clinton at the Core Club where he raised $300k.
Of course, who could forget Fancy Ford&#39;s attendance at the Play Boy Mansion... wait, sorry, that&#39;s not in NY, never mind.

New MDOR: Moving the ND Senate seat to the GOP Column. Hoeven set to announce bid for Senate tonight http://bit.ly/7lCvEB
The excerpt from “Game Change” featured in NY Mag over the weekend about John Edwards is interesting.
Through Edwards’ downfall, he sought to broker a deal with Obama to become Vice President.
Desperate to salvage something of his political career, Edwards then set his sights on Attorney General in an Obama Administration.
With nothing left to offer, Edwards got a prime-time slot at the Dem Convention, but then lost that too.
What strikes me about the whole thing is who was Edwards’ emissary trying to broker deal between the 2 camps.
Frm. Senate Maj. Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) was the messenger to the Obama camp.
But it was Leo Hindery that delivered messages to Daschle.
So, what is it about this Hindery fellow and how does he have such access?
He’s funneled millions to the Dems, that’s how. But it isn’t the amount of money, it’s how he got the money in the first place.
Hindery made a fortune at Global Crossing, leaving behind a company in ruins and many penniless. Blog it @ http://bit.ly/6hoSFB

NBC&#39;s David Gregory Tells Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner Obama&#39;s Economic Policies Have Failedhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBfm8HLZ8tI&nbsp;…
Obama’s failed economic policies indeed… straight up facts follows:
Total federal spending as proposed by Obama’s FY 2012 budget through 2021 will be $45.9 trillion http://1.usa.gov/pPJqJ6&nbsp;
Total projected U.S. debt in 2020 will be $26.3 trillion because of Obama’s fiscal irresponsibility http://1.usa.gov/pPJqJ6&nbsp;
The projected federal deficit for the current FY is $1.65 trillion – and will be the largest in U.S. history http://1.usa.gov/pPJqJ6&nbsp;
The unemployment rate rose higher in June to 9.2% http://1.usa.gov/qIbnB0&nbsp;
There are currently 44.6 million Americans receiving food stampshttp://on.wsj.com/oXWWq8&nbsp;
There are at least 14 million currently unemployed http://bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf&nbsp;…
There are also 8.6 million working only part-time http://1.usa.gov/qIbnB0&nbsp;
I think David Gregory was right, Obama&#39;s economic policies have failed.
