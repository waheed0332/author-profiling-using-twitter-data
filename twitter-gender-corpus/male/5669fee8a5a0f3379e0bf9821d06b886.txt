@directorsilk @gallicho Couple points: Re:Church dogma, as in the Assumption, a Pope does not change Church doctrine; rather, he defines it.
@directorsilk @gallicho 2nd: Assumption was not unprecedented, as Immaculate Conception was similarly defined in 1854 (albeit before Vat1).
@directorsilk @gallicho 3rd: In both instances (1854 &amp; 1950), there was massive collaboration with the will of the bishops of the world.
