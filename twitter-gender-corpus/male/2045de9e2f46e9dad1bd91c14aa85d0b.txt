@stuartfinch unfortunately not true - loads of research from the 1990&#39;s show duplex far superior to venography in leg veins
@stuartfinch we are - why do you think I post messages?????
@stuartfinch so true - hence our website http://www.legulcers.co.uk&nbsp; and the new leg ulcer charity
@stuartfinch but our research suggests leaving it causes worse problems in the future
@stuartfinch half true - embolisation probably better than ligation though
@stuartfinch doesn&#39;t work - vein lite shows veins - not which ones work or not!!!
@stuartfinch maybe true - where&#39;s the research?
@stuartfinch maybe - but probably the wrong side or the circulation - would you block the femoral artery to cure varicose veins?
@stuartfinch not necessarily true - blocking leg arterial flow wouldn&#39;t cure leg varicose veins!
@stuartfinch see other comments - HALO is probably the wrong side of the circulation
@stuartfinch you are looking at the problem upside down. Ou need to find the main reflux from above, then treat the underlying communication
@stuartfinch would need to see your results - having had a procedure doesn&#39;t mean to say it has worked
@stuartfinch so sorry to hear that Stuart - but also this diagnosis in men is still at cutting edge of research -
@stuartfinch totally agree it would be best to diagnose and cure you - but not many doctors (private nor NHS) understanding or researching
@stuartfinch difficult to discuss fully on Twitter!!! Varicography shows veins - to necessarily reflux !!!!!
@stuartfinch needs research to prove
@stuartfinch was trying to help you understand the illogical idea of HALO
@stuartfinch unfortunately one case - especially if medically difficult - is some evidence but not proof. Not all people are the same
@stuartfinch how would ou use a vein light in e pelvis :-) ????
@stuartfinch again - more research is needed to show optimal approach - not everything is known about pelvic vein reflux
@stuartfinch needs duplex to see the flow and deep connections - vein light only shows shows of blood in a vein - no useful information
@stuartfinch venography not 100% accurate as in Tweets before
@stuartfinch Hi Stuart - please send me your venograms / tests etc to me at The Whiteley Clinic - I will review and see if we can help

Halloween questions about blood and veins from The Whiteley Clinichttp://lnkd.in/bM7FEq6&nbsp;
@stuartfinch Unfortunately venogram only shows veins - it doesn&#39;t show reflux very well - so not necessarily proof.
@stuartfinch That is right - there is not enough research to show it yet - that is what we are doing in research - but we have no NHS funds
@stuartfinch The presence of dilated veins 1] doesn&#39;t mean it is the problem and 2] doesn&#39;t show where they arise from
@stuartfinch I think you misunderstand the process - everyone is allowed to treat it - but 1] do they have the expertise 2] who pays
@stuartfinch A very good case for the NHS to consider having you treated
@stuartfinch @ritamay1 that is because there is very little, if any, research done on this yet - so it is not known
@stuartfinch That procedure code can be used for any vascular mass anywhere - it doesn&#39;t mean doctors understand pelvic congestion in males

Thread/spider veins resistant to treatment - Why you must have a duplex scan before treatment http://lnkd.in/bEuSdKP&nbsp;
@stuartfinch Could well be - the real question is whether the sclerosant made any difference or would the flare up have happened anyway
@stuartfinch Absolutely - what I have been saying for 12 years - however cosmetic doctors and clinics don&#39;t even look for perforators
@stuartfinch Thant is because not enough research has been done and not enough is known about the condition
@stuartfinch In females - transvaginal duplex ultrasound is the gold standard - in males we are still trying to find a good test
@stuartfinch Unfortunately not true - lots of research shows patient can tell where the bulging vein is - not where it comes from
@stuartfinch Vein light only shows a shadow of the superficial portion of the vein - not the actual vein causing the problem
@stuartfinch Only if the heat spread outside of the vein and damaged nearby lymphatics
@stuartfinch This is exactly what we are researching at the moment - so far not able to do so
@stuartfinch Pressure depends on height of blood above the heart - it isn&#39;t a pressure problem - it is a flow and kinetic energy problem
@stuartfinch Yes - provided the right veins are embolised and done successfully - and foam sclerotherapy may also be needed
@stuartfinch Yes ... that is the usual course - you have to know which tributaries need embolization - we have done 5 recently
@stuartfinch That is called &quot;ascending venography&quot; and can help - but doesn&#39;t show blood refluxing back down
@stuartfinch I&#39;m afraid that is wrong - the vein light only shows shadows of superficial veins thorough the skin
@stuartfinch In women - Transvaginal Duplex Ultrasound - in men we are still researching for a gold standard
The Whiteley Clinic Bristol - lecture to invited doctors on the latest advances in venous disease and treatments on …http://lnkd.in/bm3PyZw&nbsp;
@stuartfinch Are you just naming tests you have heard of, or suggesting using them - non-are diagnostic for pelvic vein congestion
@stuartfinch Cavernosography shows outflow from the penis - not pelvic vein reflux
@stuartfinch NPT merely says whether you have had an erection overnight when asleep
@stuartfinch Doppler study merely checks on arterial flow into the penis - if used with a cuff then pressure can be measured
@stuartfinch Venogram has been proven many years ago not to be specific when looking for refluxing blood
@stuartfinch As before -there is no gold standard test currently for male pelvic vein reflux -if there was we wouldn&#39;t be doing our research
@stuartfinch Do you follow me? If so, I should be able to!
@stuartfinch No - doesn&#39;t work like that. Our research shows dimensions are irrelevant - only reflux seems important - needs duplex
@stuartfinch In a female, can use transvaginal duplex ultrasound - it is the current gold standard
@stuartfinch They only help - they don&#39;t diagnose pelvic vein congestion - until we have a gold standard test, nothing gives accurate answer
@stuartfinch Lots of research shows that veins that are seen and felt on the surface only occasionally show the underlying problem
@stuartfinch Again, duplex studies show that often where the symptoms are felt is not where the problem is
@stuartfinch you can see where the contrast goes (open veins) but that isn&#39;t necessarily where blood normally flows in real life
@stuartfinch I am happy to keep helping as you are clearly interested ... have you seen my book &quot;Understanding Venous Reflux&quot;? it is a start
LSA completely changed my life - under-arm sweating cured http://lnkd.in/btKBK6t&nbsp;
@stuartfinch Totally agree - have been lecturing to a group of GP&#39;s in Bristol this evening about pelvic vein problems and all agree
@stuartfinch absolutely right, we keep on pushing for people to get their veins investigated and treated properly to prevent future problems
@stuartfinch Thank you - keep in touch
Our best selling book this month so far - for all pregnant women .....http://lnkd.in/b_VZq2z&nbsp;
@stuartfinch Yes - there are 150 perforators per leg - any can become incompetent and cause varicose veins - also pelvic and buttock veins
@stuartfinch Sclerotherapy doesn&#39;t really work like that - it can close a perforator - but it can just cause a clot which temporarily works
@stuartfinch Difficult to reach perforators can be closed with TRLOP or Ultrasound foam sclerotherapy - depending on anatomy
@stuartfinch Duplex ultrasound is the only way you can be sure of which way the blood is flowing in a vein - venograms don&#39;t show flow
@stuartfinch Success of closure depends on where the vein is, it&#39;s size and shape, the technique used and who does it - nothing is 100%
@stuartfinch Too complex a question for Twitter - do you mean flow or by pushing on a vein?
@stuartfinch I don&#39;t think the HALO procedure is the right thing to do - our research shows it is a vein problem not an arterial problem
@stuartfinch not as simply as that really
@stuartfinch Better to leave the arteries alone if they are normal and fix the veins - which are abnormal

@stuartfinch Exactly :-) as in the video
Revolutionary new treatment for Scrotal Skin Cysts
http://lnkd.in/dWwxDcM&nbsp;
@stuartfinch you may be right - although many vascular surgeon are now doing these - it is hard to be sure how medicine will develop
@stuartfinch Possible - but Doppler shows an arterial flow in those
@stuartfinch Doesn&#39;t help much - was there an arterial signal?
@stuartfinch Angiogram might - but might miss it. Venogram unlikely to.
@stuartfinch Again - this is what we are researching so there is no definite answer to your question yet
@stuartfinch Not necessarily - hence the need for more research
@stuartfinch Depends on what you mean &quot;venous shunting&quot;
Pelvic veins, perforator veins and varicose veins - Prof Mark Whiteley speaking at Veith Symposium in New York http://lnkd.in/dEaxn5E&nbsp;
@stuartfinch &quot;Shunting&quot; to mean when blood is shunted from one side of the circulation to the other
@stuartfinch It could be a shunt if the systemic blood is shunted into the portal system - it is usually the other way around
@stuartfinch does&#39;t usually work line that - internal (non somatic pain) is hard to localise
@stuartfinch probably not the main or only reason
@stuartfinch it can be visualised - but not easy to visualise the function
@stuartfinch Venogram not a good test - foam sclerosant from below May help temporarily

@stuartfinch Of course - that is called Portal Hypertenision and classically leads to large veins in the oesophagus, umbilicus and piles
@stuartfinch Not directly
@stuartfinch Yes - you would need to have liver function tests (blood tests) and a liver ultrasound in the first instance - your GP can help
@stuartfinch Sometimes - depends on cause and severity of the problem
At the @VEITHsymposium in New York - putting final touches to my 3 talks for tomorrow
@stuartfinch But get the diagnosis before suggesting treatment :-)
@stuartfinch @VEITHsymposium Probably not - pelvic venous congestion is reflux - portal systemic hypertension is obstructive
@stuartfinch @VEITHsymposium At the moment we are still discussing female pelvic venous congestion
@stuartfinch @VEITHsymposium  - as tweeted before, a lot more research needed about male pelvic venous congestion

@stuartfinch yep - That is what I have writing about for the last 12 years
@stuartfinch Only in a manner of speaking. No-one should have stripping any more!
@stuartfinch Not likely to have been the cause - Stripping doesn&#39;t transfer pressure - it is just a bad operation as veins can grow back
@stuartfinch I don&#39;t work with PCT&#39;s - but you should have had a response!!
@stuartfinch Yes - we had an excellent research student this summer and have improved modified our foam sclerotherapy technique
@stuartfinch You might have been told that - but it is unlikely to be the cause - more likely they just didn&#39;t get the diagnosis right
@stuartfinch That is the problem everywhere - even in the USA there is not enough money for everyone to have the healthcare they need
@stuartfinch Simply it is part of the healing process - free blood (bruising or haematoma) encourages damaged veins to reconnect
@stuartfinch Yes - that is why we don&#39;t ligate - we treat from inside the vein which reduces this risk - endovenous treatment

@stuartfinch But they can only treat successfully if they know what tests and treatments to use - hence the need for research
@stuartfinch yes
@stuartfinch well it isn&#39;t really a pressure effect as far as we know - but again research varies on this
@stuartfinch or genetic damage
@stuartfinch Not really proven
@stuartfinch Well - there can be other reasons or it might only be temporary ... so just one results isn&#39;t proof
@stuartfinch But you can only know the right treatment to give if you have accurate diagnosis - otherwise you can over or under trreat
@stuartfinch Most doctors don&#39;t know it exists - we are trying to help them understand and get interested
@stuartfinch Thank you Stuart - we are making great strides forwards - but most GP&#39;s still won&#39;t refer patients as they don&#39;t understand
@stuartfinch Probably is - I don&#39;t deal with PCT&#39;s - only the patients and research to get the best treatments
@stuartfinch Thank you - That is what our aim is
@stuartfinch Yes - hence why we present on TV, at conferences and in social media to help everyone understand how veins SHOULD be treated
@stuartfinch not an NHS v Private problem - it is a problem of doctors knowing about veins - most still regard varicose veins as &quot;cosmetic&quot;

@stuartfinch Hi Stuart - NICE haven&#39;t produced guidelines as there are no randomised studies into this yet completed - more research needed
@stuartfinch I think we have had this conversation several times now - more research is needed - if there is no evidence, then research
@stuartfinch There is not enough research to recognise it
@stuartfinch Dangerous in what way?
@stuartfinch All doctors can treat patients in the best way that they can - it comes down to who pays for it
@stuartfinch The NHS only has a limited budget - so have to decide where to spend it
@stuartfinch Privately, you can pay for whatever you want, as long as a doctor thinks it is the right thing to do
@stuartfinch It is 1] a research argument and 2] a funding argument - not simply an NHS v Private argument
@stuartfinch I agree - hence our research
@stuartfinch That is EXACTLY the same argument I have been using over the last 10 years in trying to get doctors to listen to my research
@stuartfinch Case reports of success are not good evidence of a treatment being successful - too many variables.

Can Yoga really cure varicose veins?: http://youtu.be/Yyzx1QeIKAw?a&nbsp; via @YouTube
@stuartfinch Hi Stuart - no - Varicose veins come from valves failing from the bottom of the leg upwards - not pressure downwards
@stuartfinch Whether varicose veins are &quot;cosmetic&quot; or not depends on several factors - including duplex scan and patient symptoms
@stuartfinch It is very rare that ALL of the valves in the leg veins are incompetent - deep and superficial veins. Usually deep are still OK
@stuartfinch Hi Stuart - pelvic congestion syndrome is caused by pelvic varicose veins not leg ones
@stuartfinch You are right - it is crazy not to treat varicose veins - but not for that reason
@stuartfinch hi Stuart - iliac vein is not embolisms - the testicular or internal iliac vein can be - not the common or external iliac
@stuartfinch Also they are embolised if need to stop flow NOT to reduce pressure
@stuartfinch Pelvic venous reflux can communicate with varicose veins in the legs - see http://www.vulval-varicose-veins.co.uk&nbsp;
@stuartfinch HI Stuart, that only happens in some patients - and very few males

@stuartfinch Treatment is always possible if there is reflux - It might be foam sclerotherapy rather than embolisation

@stuartfinch Hi Stuart, As in previous messages, this is still very new and more research needed - hence virtually no evidence yet
@stuartfinch Too early yet - there are studies going on at the moment about pelvic vein embolization but it will be years yet
@stuartfinch I agree - that is an issue for NHS commissioning groups

@NURSEUNDERCOVER @stuartfinch Hi Stuart, to show how far behind doctors are - Phlebology has just rejected our paper on male pelvic veins
@stuartfinch @NURSEUNDERCOVER Hi Stuart - Have followed you - @MarkWhiteley
@stuartfinch Interesting post - the optimal way to treat is still being researched
@stuartfinch @NURSEUNDERCOVER Absolutely maddening!!! we are adding more patients and more information and are going to re-submit!!
@stuartfinch @NURSEUNDERCOVER If my paper is rejected by my peers, then they don&#39;t want to support this
@stuartfinch not sure that is correct - not everyone is curable and as said before, not enough research to know for sure
@stuartfinch I understand your distress - but the tests you had had don&#39;t show that you can be cured with certainty - see my personal reply
@stuartfinch @NURSEUNDERCOVER We are - but it takes time and we need to be sure that our research is correct too!!
@stuartfinch you misunderstand why we need a diagnostic test - without accurate test treatment is hit and miss
@stuartfinch and if the wrong veins are treated due to bad diagnostic information, these treatments worsen the problem!!
@stuartfinch if that was right, you would be fixed an we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation
@stuartfinch we also can&#39;t just experiment with patients and do things that might help them - but might make them worse ... Hence suing etc
@stuartfinch please see my reply on your own direct message
@stuartfinch Yes - we presented research on this in the UIP in Boston in Sept 2013 so is still new and not widely known by doctors

@stuartfinch Hi Stuart - there have been good reports of using foam sclerotherapy mixed with contrast and x-ray control
@stuartfinch no - have spent years treating veins thank you - is very inferior to ultrasound guidance - extravasation common with veinlite
@stuartfinch Gives no depth or direction inflammation - great as a showpiece, rubbish for scientific treatment
@stuartfinch tried it many years ago when it came out - and several other versions since - surface based technologies no use to experts
@stuartfinch Not surprised it is cheap - it is no use - even 15 pounds is a waste of money
