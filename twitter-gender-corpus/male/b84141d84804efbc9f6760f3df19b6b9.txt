Cisco to buy cybersecurity firm Sourcefire for $2.7 billion http://cnb.cx/17AJGZ9&nbsp; /via @areino
Now you can&#39;t tell that Cisco has a crappy IDS :)
But at the end of the day, an IDS is like an AV, it helps you to detect some bad stuff, but just some.
At least IDS allow you to set up and tailor the rules
@DennisF @cBekrar xDD
Is Cisco going to keep the Sourcefire brand (I hope so) or it will be renamed as Cisco IPS2 or some obscure acronym?
Sorry for being so pessimist,but is there any success story of a security product acquisition by Cisco? #pun

How a Crypto &#39;Backdoor&#39; Pitted the Tech World Against the NSA http://Wired.com&nbsp;http://bit.ly/1dGcy5x&nbsp;
Great sessions in Copenhagen.I did emphasized the importance of being proactive vs being reactive by monitoring and profiling your attackers
It is important to detect and analyze the tools and methods your attackers are using against other targets. At least the known unknowns :)
But it is important to comply with the privacy laws, so you’d better check them before gathering intelligence about your attackers

Great sessions in Copenhagen.I did emphasized the importance of being proactive vs being reactive by monitoring and profiling your attackers
It is important to detect and analyze the tools and methods your attackers are using against other targets. At least the known unknowns :)
But it is important to comply with the privacy laws, so you’d better check them before gathering intelligence about your attackers

After playing for some days with SAML IdPs and Service Providers I only can say that it is PITA :)
&quot;SAML is the Windows XP of Identity. No funding. No innovation. People still use it. But it has no future&quot;
&quot;There is no future for SAML. No one is putting money into SAML development. NO ONE is writing new SAML code. SAML is dead.”
@lsaiz I&#39;m not frustrated, but happy :) I don&#39;t like SAML at all.there is only one thing that I hate more: a SAML Java implementation :)

Wow if it&#39;s true that @FireEye has acquired @Mandiant it is really a shocking movement
&#39;FireEye now has a $5 billion market capitalization, despite the fact it has yet to turn a profit.&#39;
IMHO @Mandiant acquisition by @FireEye is a really smart one, but let&#39;s see how products and services bundle together
A billion bucks. It was the same amount FaceBook offered to the SnapChat guys. :)
