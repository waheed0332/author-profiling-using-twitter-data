Dates for the 2012 season of Air Pirates Radio Theater announced to cast today. Get ready! Gonna be a great season. Show details to follow.
Cowboys vs Giants: I think only their fans care who wins this wknd, because neither teams appears to want it.

@DavidCallinan Good morning (afternoon for you).  Thanks very much for following me.
@lapetitecupcake For me, if the bacon&#39;s real crispy, NO toast. If it&#39;s not crispy, toast (contrasting textures).
@lapetitecupcake Maybe she&#39;s trying to audition for a vampire flick.
@lapetitecupcake I&#39;d almost rather have a zombie apocolypse than be overrun by hermaphroditic Belle sippy cup drones.
@lapetitecupcake I like a little chew to it.  BUT for the BLT, I go with crispy on white bread.
@lapetitecupcake @WeAreEverAfter It&#39;s not a 2nd hand celebrity lingerie store, is it?
@lapetitecupcake @pardeangel It&#39;s got to be toast AND crispy bacon on a club, or you tug the sandwich apart.
@lapetitecupcake Not to drag out this old debate, but: unicorns vs hermaphrotide Belle sibby cup drones? Who would win?
@lapetitecupcake Unless it&#39;s an S&amp;M club. Wait.  That works on a couple of levels, doesn&#39;t it?
@bassoforhire @lapetitecupcake @WeAreEverAfter because 2nd hand celebrity lingerie raises some interesting possibilities.
@lapetitecupcake However, that in no way should disparage DJD.  It&#39;s merely a simile.

ONE ON ONE - Four Plays in One Night http://bassoforhire.blogspot.com/2012/06/one-on-one-four-plays-in-one-night.html&nbsp;…
Last night on FNS, &quot;Good thing we already ate.&quot;  BEST LINE OF THE WEEKEND!!  Thanks for the belly laugh. @altonbrown
@GPTimes @AltonBrown That line almost as good as Hulk&#39;s beat down of Loki.
@TimothyMalcolm It&#39;s probably the potatoes.

@FallingSkiesTNT Well, I THINK so.  But I&#39;m still not sure.  Trust, but verify.
@lapetitecupcake @rosannascotto @gregkellyfox5 Wait - there&#39;s strippers covering for someone? Isn&#39;t that an oxymoron?
@bassoforhire @lapetitecupcake @rosannascotto @gregkellyfox5 Oh, CONSOLING, not covering.  Okay, that makes more sense (I guess).  Carry on.
@bassoforhire @lapetitecupcake @rosannascotto @gregkellyfox5 &quot;Fox5 - We console - You decide.&quot;
@lapetitecupcake To quote your recent H &amp; O reference, &quot;it&#39;s a bitch, girl.&quot;
@lapetitecupcake I knew a girl who had that once.
@lapetitecupcake She got it when she got caught in the rain without her falafel.
@lapetitecupcake Oh, no!
@lapetitecupcake See what happens when you go out in the rain without your falafel?
I&#39;ll bet all the sweet, green icing was flowing down, wasn&#39;t it? @lapetitecupcake
@lapetitecupcake You must have left that cake out in the rain when the strippers on Fox5 disctracted you.
@lapetitecupcake ...or leap ONto it.  Now THAT&#39;S quality daytime programming.
@lapetitecupcake Loving this thread.  I may turn it into my next BFH blogpost.
@lapetitecupcake Now I just have to relocate all of them.  Maybe DJD could throw the cake at the strippers.
@lapetitecupcake Nor does DJD.
@lapetitecupcake Kinda like 5;5, by the way.
@guarnaschelli That&#39;s a theory that I&#39;ve long held, but have unfortunately never been able to successfully test.

Bazinga! @altonbrown I thought he did very well. &amp; like you said, the same guy heckled him 4 times.
I didn&#39;t think they were obnoxious.  They were completely him and part of why I like him. @altonbrown
@altonbrown No. That&#39;s a cat IN a sombrero. I think the tweeter wants you to use a sombrero to draw a cat.
@ugottafriend @altonbrown Excellent point.
