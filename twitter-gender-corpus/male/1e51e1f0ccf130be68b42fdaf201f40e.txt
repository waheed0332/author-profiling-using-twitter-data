Pipeline fighter @janekleeb will be testifying before Congress today. Read her powerful speech here: http://boldnebraska.org/testimony&nbsp;
&quot;America’s national interest is not served by a project that lines the pockets of the few, while risking the lives of the many,&quot; @janekleeb
Here&#39;s to five years of keeping KXL unbuilt, tar sands in the ground, oil out of our water, and carbon out of our atmosphere.
Since #KXL was proposed 5 years ago, the world has had 3 of 10 hottest years ever &amp; 2013 is on pace to join them (via @MilesGrant)
5 years of delay for Keystone XL. And 40 years of delay for any real climate action out of Congress.
Wow. Despicable, boorish behavior from @RepBillJohnson towards @janekleeb and the American people. What a shill.
.@RepBillJohnson has taken $256,611 of dirty energy money during his career. Any guess why he&#39;s pushing for KXL?

If only the Tigers would cave like Republicans.
I love hearing about investment firms like Trillium that are taking #divestment far beyond our original top 200 fossil fuel companies list
We need to expand the idea of sustainable reinvestment beyond solar and wind to efficiency, batteries, tech, transit, water management, etc
Will Lana from Trillium: the financial community has done far more complicated things than figure out how to divest from fossil fuels.
The $140 million Russell Family Foundation divested from the Filthy 15 coal companies after reading @billmckibben&#39;s Rolling Stone article
The Russell 3000 is one of the most famous economic indexes. The family behind it has divested from coal -- and wants to do more.

Brown&#39;s reasons not to divest don&#39;t hold up. Here&#39;s why: http://bit.ly/1a8QLyW&nbsp; #divestment
Outrageous: .@BrownUniversity Pres. Paxson says coal doesn&#39;t pose enough social harm to warrant divestment.
.@BrownUniversity says #divestment doesn&#39;t make an impact. Academic studies (oh, and history) say different:http://bit.ly/1a8QLyW&nbsp;
Bad PR move: @BrownUniversity announces it won&#39;t divest from coal on the anniversary of Hurricane Sandy.
Scandalous: Numerous @BrownUniversity board members have big financial stakes in the coal industry:http://bit.ly/1a8SeoT&nbsp;

Impossible not to have hope when you look at the growing climate movement: diverse, global &amp; growing. #WeStandWithYou #Volveremos

Singapore is stretching the metaphors at #COP19, &quot;We need an appendectomy, not just a circumcision.&quot; Ouch.
Don&#39;t count on our politicians to avert the climate crisis. In many ways, they are the crisis: http://bit.ly/18foqwR&nbsp;

@tomzellerjr hence, #divestment.
Amazing! A &quot;Parts Per Million&quot; arts intervention from @liberatetate protests BP sponsorship of #TateModern http://bit.ly/1iE4DJl&nbsp;
Much love from @350 to our friends at @liberatetate. Few things make us happier than wonky/artistic protest! http://bit.ly/1iE4DJl&nbsp;
A few days after carbon bubbles visit the Bank of England, carbon particles intervene at #TateModern. CO2 is acting up!
@liberatetate You better believe it. Send it to me via email and we&#39;ll get our team on it.
Inclusion of loss &amp; damage in the #COP19 outcome is an important. Countries acknowledge that climate change is already causing major impacts
After #COP19, the UNFCCC process is still on life support, despite efforts by big polluters to pull the plug.
@Alberto_Zoratti true, but a hell of a fight just to get it there. a first step in a longer battle.
#WeStandWithYou tumblr already full of photos from around the world. Add yours here: http://westandwithyou.tumblr.com/&nbsp; #COP19 #volveremos
@Alberto_Zoratti for sure. All the more reason to up the fight against the polluters holding back progress.
@anjaliapp thanks!
WWF calls the lack if urgency at #COP19 &quot;sickening.&quot;
&quot;Polluting industries cast a long shadow over these talks,&quot; @WWF #COP19
&quot;Massive public pressure&quot; is needed to rescue a climate deal, says @Oxfam. Our crew at @350 couldn&#39;t agree more!
I think #COP19 has helped toughen up the climate movement. We&#39;re coming out geared up for a fight with the fossil fuel industry.
@TasneemEssop @climateWWF The Panda really showed its teeth this COP. Looking forward to kicking some more butt together.

Instead of sponsoring the #TateModern, BP should start sponsoring the Thames Barrier:http://nyti.ms/1kiKNRV&nbsp;
A storm surge with 8-inches of sea level rise is forcing Europe to deploy all its storm barriers. If seas rise 7ft, how do we adapt to that?

@Vluck Nice article on the fossil fuel #divestment movement, but worth noting that colleges long resisted divesting from apartheid too
Colleges are now proud to have divested from apartheid, but many of them resisted for years. Same scenario with fossil fuel #divestment.
@swiftnotswallow @williammclennan genius!
On an all-staff call w/ the @350 team. 15+ countries and some of the most amazing organizers on the planet. So much fun.
Good reminder of how Harvard fought student demands to divest from apartheid for years before finally caving: http://bit.ly/18m9CMF&nbsp;

John Kerry connects Typhoon Haiyan to climate change. He shouldn&#39;t approve a pipeline that makes it worse:http://nyti.ms/JB3bdn&nbsp;
