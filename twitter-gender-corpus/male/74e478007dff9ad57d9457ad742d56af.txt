&quot;Why California Can&#39;t Be Home to the Hyperloop&quot;-An article saying that California is bad for business has to be BS http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/227807#&nbsp;!

@dtunkelang @usabart no worries. It&#39;s good to read things you don&#39;t agree with... occasionally :-)

Since @twitter does not allow for an easy partitioning of my feed into topics, I created @xamat_music for my twitter #music
@_amrahmed Thanks Amr... really appreciate it!
@pathak_s @twitter @Quora I think it&#39;s very easy to figure out topics users I follow belong to. You can then split feed according to source
@elversatile @Jetlore There is nothing in that URL except for a server welcome message. Is the system down?
@IgorBrigadir @twitter @xamat_music they could be an option if they also filtered listed people from my main feed.
@elversatile I just signed up. I will let you know. But, from what I read it looks more like @Zite or @Prismatic

&quot;Scientiﬁc Articles Recommendation&quot; - Interesting work at #cikm2013 using topic-regression matrix factorization
@yueshi_nl They cite that paper. According to authors main difference is that they also regularize through a Gaussian Prior (besides LDA)

According to @ted_dunning, most important recsys issues are exploration, diversity, and speed. And #netflixPrize was useless :-/ #cikm2013
One of the most important findings in #recsys in the last 20 years is Result Dithering @ted_dunning #cikm2013 - really?
I do have to say that now @ted_dunning is going into more principled E/E approaches such as Thompson Sampling #cikm2013
(shameless plug) I will be giving my #cikm2013 talk tomorrow 4 pm. And possibly replying to some of @ted_dunning&#39;s claims today ;-)
Now Deepak Agarwal on computational advertising at LinkedIn #cikm2013 - reminded me about some famous quote by @hackingdata
Not sure what Deepak meant when saying Explore/Exploit was introduced by Yahoo in Academia in 2008 #cikm2013 - its practical application?
.@LinkedInEng uses ADMM for large-scale logistic regression + Thompson Sampling for explore/exploit - Deepak Agarwal #cikm2013
