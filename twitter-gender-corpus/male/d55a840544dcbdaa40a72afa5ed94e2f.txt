Lambert in(effective): Greyson Lambert gets his first series of the game. An 0-for-3 three-and-out.

Virginia&#39;s job, conversely, is to force a three-and-out. Tech should still run the ball at least on first and... http://fb.me/2C8HrneTJ&nbsp;
Virginia has shown nothing since its first two drives in terms of ability to move the ball. Tech just needs to... http://fb.me/2DgdhtFqQ&nbsp;
Go for it here, and you get it, great. Tech runs the clock inside 6:30 at worst. Don&#39;t get it, and Virginia gets a spark. I kick it.
Virginia doesn&#39;t have two scoring drives in them right now. Why give them a chance?
Smart football by Frank Beamer. There&#39;s something new.
Kendall Fuller INT probably seals it: Greyson Lambert way off target after after a Parks&#39; 48-yard run gets Virginia into VT territory.

Lots of empty seats less than a minute before pregame intros.
First media timeout: UVa. 6, Wisconsin 2
Second media timeout: UVa. 13, Wisconsin 11
Justin Anderson=LeBron James blocking layups on fast breaks. You have to know that going in.
This game is settling into the hockey game that we all expected going in.
Under-8 media timeout: Tied at 14. Akil Mitchell has three fouls.
Akil Mitchell with 3 fouls, Darion Atkins with 2. Good thing Tony Bennett has depth in the frontcourt this year.... http://fb.me/1vRlmnRHM&nbsp;

The football refs they&#39;re using for this game don&#39;t seem to mind letting shooters get hit while putting the ball up on the rim, do they?
Half: Wisconsin 25, UVa. 20
The Internet on press row today is spotty at best. Almost as ugly as this basketball game.
A loss here tonight, and the best that you&#39;ll be able to grade the November-December portion of UVa.&#39;s season is a... http://fb.me/R0ykG1Ir&nbsp;
Wisconsin controls on D, ups lead to 10: Badgers on a modest 5-0 run out of the locker room, up 30-20. UVa. calls... http://fb.me/P4Zjkjrp&nbsp;
Wisconsin 37, UVa. 23, 10:05 to go. UVa. has 10 points in the last 23:13. This game is over. Virginia will not get to 37.
My in-game stats aren&#39;t working. Not much here associated with UVa. is working tonight.
That three by Josh Gasser will be the dagger. Wisconsin 42-30, 6:19
Virginia has 30 points in 34 minutes. The &#39;Hoos need to outscore Wisconsin by 12 in the last six to win. Don&#39;t see it happening tonight.
My two seatmates on press row are from Badger Nation. i feel like I&#39;m in the movie &quot;Fargo&quot; with the accents.... http://fb.me/1ZRBWsIif&nbsp;
UVa. still down 11 with 3:56 to go, and has 32 points in 36:04. A comeback here would be a miracle, and... http://fb.me/6qiSIiIGE&nbsp;
Virginia is 3-15 from the field this half and has made just 5 of its last 30 shots overall.
Just not enough possessions left. Wisconsin would have to go ohfer the rest of the way.
Four fouls in 20 seconds? Are you kidding me?
When a Virginia player gets hit shooting the ball, it&#39;s not a foul. When a Wisconsin kid is hand-checked 40 feet away, it&#39;s a foul.
One more Wisconsin basket, and it&#39;s over. Cavs have cut the deficit to 44-38 with 1:40 to go, but too much has to... http://fb.me/3ewGptcQP&nbsp;
And conversely, Wisconsin has to really screw up. A turnover, a foul on a three-point shooter, etc.
Duck your shoulder, run through a UVa. defender, and it&#39;s a foul.
Final analysis: You don&#39;t win too many games with 11 made field goals.
Nor do you lose too many games holding the other team to 28.8 percent shooting from the field. Except tonight.
