Friday October 11th 2013 is a sad day. The heating has gone back on. One is not amused.
@kentprivateeye that WAS the plan! We are the lowest paid, not sure if that&#39;s an official stat but it&#39;s true!
@kentprivateeye happy to recommend you for insulation?!
@kentprivateeye I&#39;m not choosy, I tell people we can insulate anything!
Just completed my 51st hour of the week! Nice!
Anyone know what was being filmed in #margate today? Big old crew, I reckon @BBCCrimewatch ?
@MartinSLewis I have BG smart meter, 4 hours of heating our 3 bed terrace, is £1.35, reasonably efficient boiler, maybe helpful to share?

My biggest regret of 2013 was not seeing The Stones at @GlastoFest or Hyde park.
My biggest regret of 2014 will be stripping completely naked at @theboyroos and @pinkgypsy1 wedding
Before the vows
I was wondering where @dean_itfc was and then he pops up like a rash
My absolute highlight of 2013 was having my tweet favourited by the greatest rock and roll band everpic.twitter.com/1chvSKLjon
@kevinbridges86 a bar in Ramsgate (fucking miles from you) used to sell it on draft. In pints. Mad.
@rockgod1970 when it appeared you were the first person I though of! It&#39;s twitter top trumps!
@rockgod1970 I unfollowed him!
@Adem that&#39;s when @pinkgypsy1 said they were shit! Never liked her #itwillneverlast
@OSLioness you got barred from The Royal
@theboyroos @Adem @pinkgypsy1 fuck all bless her, fuck all
I predict @rockgod1970 is desperately tweeting celebs. Between wanks.
The fat guitarist looks like he drives them all home in a cab! #rollingstones
Thank god for twitter, how else would I have known its raining?
@Adem we tweeted at exactly the same time! I am outside, do you need owt?

@Natures_Voice hi, are you allowed to have a pet owl?! Particularly a large one in a small flat?
@davepoflynn fuck all else to do!
It would appear any plans @Ianhwatkins had to be pedophile have been somewhat scuppered by bad journalism! (Not saying he did of course!)
@davepoflynn any &quot;movement&quot;

@posiekins technically
@O2 it&#39;s not great, I work in the field and it&#39;s generally the case across east Kent regardless of what the postcode checker says.
@MadgeHooks revellers? Thats not very working class yorkshire! London has changed you!
@robbeckettcomic presumably legally?
@ThanetGazette a door fire? A door? Fire?
@peterdav2000 @ZoeMurphyDesign how will you dry the pans if its frames?

Sounds like yet another bin has blown over in my #Ramsgate street. Be safe out there #storm q
@ScottWilkins2 @Kent_999s no, a repair truck
This weather is much worse than the &quot;bad weather&quot; a few weeks back!
@DavidThanet course, no credit required! UK Power Networks and Kent Highways were on site if it helps?
@DavidThanet also I didn&#39;t ACTUALLY see it blown down!
@MissSeaPeaches The Streets, Blinded by The Lights

@Andrewq1978 last night was a proper storm too!!
@SkySportsNews oh? I didn&#39;t dream that?
@ThanetGazette has to be better than flats!
I just googled &quot;new spurs manager&quot; and up popped @Ianhwatkins , he gets blamed for everything!
Worse job in the world today? Being a @UKPowerNetworks engineer!
I have a child. It does not eat. At all. In 8 days, maybe 2 slices of bread, 1/4 tin of spag, handful carrots, an orange. How do I fix it?
#timsherwood once saidpic.twitter.com/Hr5iRV0nbg
@Andrewq1978 she must be hungry! She has not eaten! She would easily eat a chocolate bar though!
@Andrewq1978 she isn&#39;t eating though, yesterday she had half s small tin of spag and a satsuma but that&#39;s it, nothing today so far
@GoodDeedLaura thanks, I am convinced its behavioural rather than anything else, frustrating though!
@RRRamsgate I guess there is fruit in it?
@ConMend it&#39;s in the last place you will look so look there first
@ConMend where else have you looked since? See I was right!
@thrylmargate any top secret parking spaces I need to know about? We are on our way!

Anyone know of and ideally recommend a cheap, online kitchen co.?
Loads of people have said order online but no one has said where!!
@RRRamsgate how bizarre!! Just on that site, is it straight forward, ordering etc? Did you design it?
@RoyalBarkBisc the kitchen itself, probably go to AO for appliances
@RRRamsgate ta, I&#39;ll look into
@RRRamsgate that&#39;s what we have done!
@RRRamsgate nah, we have had them do it twice! They should be about £5000 cheaper then we would buy off them!
@RoyalBarkBisc I think wren are quite expensive, they are opening up Westwood soon, trying to avoid big companies
@RoyalBarkBisc ta, I&#39;ll have a look

@rockgod1970 @dryathlon challenge??
@dryathlon nah, last year getting sponsorship was literally like getting blood out of a stone, much less stress to drink!
Thanks @HarveysHQ for getting sofas fixed, good luck with the 2014 year long sale!
@HarveysHQ I suspect there will only be 8 days of the year  you DON&#39;T have a sale!
I built thatpic.twitter.com/efSr8q1EHy
@qprrforme as if I would look up the instructions online? What do you take me for?!
@theboyroos really is ok, but @pinkgypsy1 ? She&#39;s just the greatest!
We are playing a brilliant game, this is one of the cards!pic.twitter.com/fuHgOodOkQ
@Adem we were just talking about you, and how you&#39;ve changed x
@Adem true, but we must drink!
@Adem sorry?!
@SydneyFun @peterdav2000 London totally pissed on them!
Probably. Best. NYE. Ever. X
I may as well do @dryathlon again this year, it&#39;s 0903 and I&#39;ve not had a drink yet! #willpower #easy
@BritishGasHelp blimey joe, you are putting the hours in recently!
We had 2 men round yesterday to quote to repair our roof, the quotes were £420 and £60!
@MadgeHooks a while back we had a quote for £600, it&#39;s just random numbers out of a hat!
@rockgod1970 oddly, but more sensibly, the £420 one
@BritishGasHelp you and me both! If anyone asks you about their broken meter in east Kent tell them the engineer is busy, thanks!
@MadgeHooks I don&#39;t think you are taking this very seriously!
Oh, let me die where I lie, beneath the curse of my lovers eyes
@marlowetheatre I think it&#39;s terrible you employ a murderess as &quot;Good Fairy&quot; I must inform the authorities (unless I can have 3 free tix?!)
How can Ole Gunnar Solksjaer be @CardiffCityFC manager? He is about 7! #solskjaer
Bloody idiots on @BBCRadio2 earlier moaning about @MPSinthesky grrrr!!
Had a weak moment earlier , went into @Tesco , 1st time in months, left my mars bar on till, miserable cow wouldn&#39;t give me replacement!!
@Tesco that&#39;s 60p you owe me Tesco!!
@posiekins @BBCRadio2 @MPSinthesky saying they should not take pictures out of the helicopter as they are paid by taxpayers
@Tesco I know! I only had a mars  cos were no snickers left! Terrible! It was Manston and the stroppy cow on self serve said not handed in!
@Tesco there&#39;s a lot the store can do, 1) try smiling, she really must hate her job!
@Tesco  2) does she really think I am going to try and con Tesco out of 60p?
@Tesco 3)does she really think I would walk across a car park in the bloody rain? For a mars bar?   Unless I&#39;d paid for it? Receipt in hand?
@Tesco manston, Ramsgate
@Tesco I&#39;m not asking you to do anything beyond understanding the principles of common courtesy and the basics of good customer service?
@Adem and you a chicken lover? Terrible!
@Adem @amyeee it was alive once. Chickens have feelings too!
@ConMend I think you should have stood a bit further away to take picture
Who the bloody hell,is Gemma Collins?
@emilyeavis @GlastoFest can I get tickets by post or by calling in person please?
@Adem @Andrewq1978 neither big nor clever
@ginger_nats I don&#39;t know what TOWIE is no matter how big you say it?
@theboyroos @Adem @Andrewq1978 have you ever actually been to Liverpool? Do you know where Liverpool is?
I was on the London Underground today, &quot;the Tube&quot; if you&#39;re a local. Someone aboard had Jesus as her iPhone screensaver, underground!!
@peterdav2000 what&#39;s it about?
@peterdav2000 @CarltonCinema it&#39;s brilliant!
@peterdav2000 you are welcome, obviously never seen my stand up!!
@peterdav2000 oh.
Ah, Dolly was a dolly #takemeout
@razdaz66 been to the special car park again today, I&#39;m now a regular!
@dean_itfc Have you been saving all you tweets up for one onslaught?
I have joined @LinkedIn not sure what, how or why, is anyone on there &quot;Shelf Filler at Asda&quot;? Rather than &quot;Head of Replenishment at Asda&quot;?
@kentprivateeye @posiekins @LinkedIn oh, &quot;deletes&quot;
@Gemma_Blythe brilliant oicture
@ThanetGazette @ShepherdNeame it&#39;s well over due!! It&#39;s looking very shabby
@MPSinthesky if you didnt take that picture I would have to go through life having never seen that and that would be bad! Well done!
@The_Glass_Jar time for a price review?!
I have probably updated my facebook status more times this year then for all of 2013, not good
@alfiemoore everyone knows even the dr can&#39;t fix the gays!
@BudgensBroadway what about @TomThumbTheatre ?
@The_Glass_Jar no, but I hope to rectify this soon, hope it&#39;s going well?
I went to a really nice hotel today, it was in sittingbourne!! #thingsyouneverthoughtyoudsee
@SkintLondon @tubbsmcguire what if he&#39;s married? I am guessing he won&#39;t be for much longer!
@RamsgateMH LA to Ramsgate? Wow
I am not shocked by #benefitsstreet one little bit.  This is real life, I meet similar people every single day. (Most are nob heads!)
Fun Guy looks a right bundle of laughs! #benefitsstreet
@smellynat82 it&#39;s real life my love!
@smellynat82 there&#39;s areas I go where you would be seen as the disgrace!
Poor old White Dee, with all these scumbags popping in she ain&#39;t had time to run the Hoover round, #benefitsstreet
No, no, no, this is not right at all #livingdolls
Feck my actual luck! The http://femskin.com&nbsp; website is down! #livingdolls

@RoyalBarkBisc sssh, I&#39;m trying to watch!
@posiekins then you&#39;ll never know
@JasonManford Southend has a season?!
@MarkSimmonsHaHa @St_StoneStudios does work in progress mean it may be shit?
I hope to launch a little business this year, can&#39;t be hard can it?
@Adem I&#39;ve not entirely thought it out but it will need a web presence!!
@posiekins lend us a quid then
@posiekins booze!
@Adem @posiekins no just booze booze
@posiekins retail, unless I can muster up £20,000 then pub
@MissSeaPeaches something you wish to share?
@MissSeaPeaches I thought you was building up to a big announcement (again!!)
@theboyroos @posiekins indeed! But I don&#39;t have £20,000 so have to think even smaller than micro!
@jurassiccoastin @MissSeaPeaches Lucy!! You could have bloody told him, that&#39;s a bit wrong!!
@MissSeaPeaches @jurassiccoastin ooo touchy, must be the hormones
@theboyroos @posiekins I&#39;m crap at home brew! And you can&#39;t sell it!!
@posiekins is it cheap?
@MissSeaPeaches a date and a venue? That&#39;s it done surely?
@theboyroos UNDATEABLES IS BACK TOMORROW!!!!

Hayley&#39;s sister is hot #Undateables
@ChrisBComedian all of them, I am the success story
As well as #undateables the @jowhiley show on @BBCRadio2 is totally incredible tonight!
@ChrisBComedian I think Holly would like Trevor
@theboyroos will you fancy me?
@theboyroos @MissSeaPeaches @pinkgypsy1 was your first date like this? Look at you now!
It was all going well with Hayley and Chris until she made the fatal error of letting him meet her very tasty little sister #Undateables
Easy, jet! #Undateables
@rockgod1970 you would be all over it!
Eh?? Where&#39;s #kavos gone?!

Do you #shoplocal ? Had a knackered dyson, took it to this fella in #margate and it&#39;s fixed! Good as new, £20!!pic.twitter.com/PH9S9v89MN
@Adem is that a starvation diet?!
What did dads do at dance schools before the Internet?
@SpursOfficial why does the game not get postponed? Surely a better idea?
@LHBmargate are you open to commoners tonight? Should have time to say hello!
@GaryLineker is there more than one in Canada?
Hair of the dog?pic.twitter.com/W26tOeE8yF
@kathlaaaa are you a former smoker?
@kathlaaaa no because it is filthy dirty scummy! But I am genuinely impressed! Well done! Bet B&amp;H goes bust now!
@kathlaaaa if I send you a daily tweet knocking you down and saying you&#39;ll never do it, will it help?
@kathlaaaa I&#39;LL GIVE YOU A WEEK!! How has Hayley taken the news??!
A most delightful evening had by all with brilliant food @BowsKitchen and delicious ale @aleandcider , as good as it gets
@kathlaaaa still going strong?
@robbeckettcomic @lionsdencomedy touché
@robbeckettcomic there&#39;s always a slot for you at Christchurch SU (CT10 campus)
Sash my loves #benefitsstreet is on
I will forever be grateful to White Dee for my most successful tweet to date #benefitsstreet
Woah! Surely you can&#39;t live with a 15.5 yr old wife in UK even if legal in your own country? #benefitsstreet
focussing on  wrong people on #benefitsstreet , the hard workers living in fear of their lives or the actual scrounging scum?
My job takes me to all the best places, said me at no time ever
I do suspect if I was a celeb in the 60s and 70s I would have been in court today #operationyewtree
@rockgod1970 you&#39;ve been in hiding since 1998!
There&#39;s a Chinese takeaway in St Mary&#39;s Bay and it&#39;s proudly displaying its 3/5 food hygiene rating in its window, this makes me queasy!
@amyeee hello The Girl, can you ask The Boy if a thing for listening to iPod whilst swimming is a good thing? What&#39;s the thing called?
@theboyroos @amyeee alright don&#39;t go overboard!! Was it good? Why did she get rid?
@kathlaaaa still an ox? Will power alone or crystal meth?
@kathlaaaa well done! After a week it&#39;s easy, just ask Pete Doherty
Sonia has done alright for herself.  Martin must be kicking himself.
@MissSeaPeaches I went to loads!! Was dragged! Hop farm one is good if back home or detling
@MissSeaPeaches doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t nick the ideas!
Not sure i can watch #findingmumanddad I&#39;m out!
@PeppaPigUK is getting her very special package!
pic.twitter.com/6C7GRJejSw
I like eyes #TheUndateables
guess what? At the next Hodder family gathering the wife is going to pretend she has developed Tourette&#39;s! It will be mint!! #thundercats
“@GaryLineker: Over 2 hours to a call centre. My personal best. Thrilled! Thanks BT.” Wonder what @BTCare would say?
He&#39;s gone ever so pale! #TheUndateables
They&#39;ll be married by the time the profiteroles come out #TheUndateables
Not sure if this year we will make the normal trip to @CenterParcsUK , I think we will give #sunnybeach a try instead
@posiekins I assume that&#39;s a joke?!
@posiekins you should go to sunny beach, right up your street
Why would you unfollow me of all people?
@kathlaaaa I know! The C!
44 years after Ken Barlow squeezed your tits you stand up in court and talk about it? 44 years? Please! #freetheweatherfieldone
@rockgod1970 you are safe for 30 years at least!
@rockgod1970 it will be called Operation Thorley
@msjenniferjames I&#39;m not even starting with this
#freetheweatherfieldone
@SkyNewsBreak one of the first places I would have looked!!
@posiekins @Andrewq1978 @SkyNewsBreak we see the obvious without going round the houses?
@posiekins @Andrewq1978 the right way is to rule out the obvious before exploring every avenue
@posiekins @Andrewq1978 they must of, that&#39;s why it took 3 days to find him, they knew he was there but wanted to be sure
@dean_itfc Simon has one in his van!
@dean_itfc the love juice of Ken Barlow. Probably.
@Adem course it does you are King Djemil of the DIY People!

@christchurchsu someone had a good night!
@rockgod1970 @ThanetGazette @Nigel_Farage is that you in the onsie?
#margate let itself down with the @Nigel_Farage protest today, most of them goons probably didnt even know what they were protesting about!
Parenting skills have nothing to do with being on benefits! They are due to intelligence and common sense #benefitsstreet
@theboyroos I&#39;ve got loads, shall I pop some round?
@dean_itfc 11 is lunchtime!
@Gemma_Blythe what? Everything was 49.5p? Bargain!
