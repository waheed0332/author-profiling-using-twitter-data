Common misconception: @sgblank doesn&#39;t believe in planning. No- just don&#39;t develop operating/business/execution plan b4 product/market fit
Half-life of a VP of Sales in a startup about 14 months- @sgblank
Org charts and titles are toxic to startups early on: @sgblank
&quot;Somehow people seem to spend $1 more than the venture money they raise&quot;  @sgblank
Who is using the business model canvas?
&quot;technology is nice but it&#39;s not the business folks&quot; @sgblank

&quot;don&#39;t confuse the price of your product with your actual revenue model&quot; make sure u have one: @sgblank @bobdorf @leanlaunchpad
ok, so it&#39;s getting to that time: almost ready for people to.... &quot;get out of the building!!&quot; @sgblank @bobdorf @leanlaunchpad
Q: &quot;what does testing the problem mean&quot; A: don&#39;t pitch &#39;Em on your product right away, do they *have* a problem? If so what is it? @sgblank
deep: &quot;what if we could solve your problem like this?&quot; @sgblank @bobdorf
&quot;founders- you actually have to start with an opinion...&quot; just be ready to test it and for it to change.. @sgblank @leanlaunchpad
&quot;market researchers are great at predicting the past&quot; entrepreneurs are trying to change the future @leanlaunchpad
&quot;Listen for the outlier data, not to survey monkey data.. E&#39;ship is an art, not an accounting exercise&quot; Learn how to *really* listen
