Sure, I&#39;ll make great art with you and go to France for it. I mean, if I have to.
@nicolegeary great to meet you in LA! This is a year-ish long project, which&#39;ll involve tests in MKE, Montreal and more. Yay art!
Just got a big university grant to finish a suite of interactive installations: equipment, catalog, laptop, assistants + travel $$. Yay.

@wugmump saturday afternoon play / night sleepover? Just me + Nonie, June 9...
@wugmump could maybe even do AEOLIAN RIDE GOVERNER&#39;s ISLAND...?
@artcity @staceywng  interesting. how will our roles coalesce?
MT @staceywng: Well I (can also) plan to just mostly look on from afar, act bossy, and aim the occasional poignant statement at @artcity
Completely overwhelmed by all the birthday wishes. Thank you! What I want: a new governor. Here&#39;s hoping my birthday wish comes true!
I suppose I knew this was coming, but was hoping it wouldn&#39;t. America / WI: things are going to get way worse. And you voted for it. Sigh.
@wugmump why do you hate me?
Scary yet understandable how many colleagues + teachers have mentioned being back on the job market in the last 12 hours. #wisconsin
i love #tweetsinspace
Awesome day with @wugmump + family at Figment, going back to Gov Island again to see Jill LaRocco Buckley-Jones &amp; Jessica Findley today.

Nauseous in Detroit, but pretty sure it&#39;s lack of sleep, dehydration and plane / motion sickness rather than anything inherent to the city.
My new bicycle lasted 4 days before it, too, was stolen. That is 3 stolen bikes (with locks!) in less than 3 weeks. #angry

Super fun discussion about my work at the exploratorium here in San Francisco! Thanks to the attending crowd...
Term 2. We’ve got Tammy Baldwin and Elizabeth Warren in the Senate, Alan Grayson in the House (pun intended). Let’s get some work done!!!
Probably should have checked if SF MoMA was open before heading over. Ah well, I still get to see art at alt venues tonight!

6.42 miles at around a 9:05 pace (10 min first mile, increasing all along), with Maurice Dumit. Then a great brunch with Josie Osborne.
AWESOME. RT @ilona_andrews: Okay, I would so totally watch this.http://youtu.be/07s-cNFffDM&nbsp;
Totally emo the last few days. Need to chill. Breathe, Nathaniel.
I think I need a &quot;no inbox after 7pm&quot; rule. I can still work if I need to, but no inbox. Thoughts?
Day 1 of “no inbox after 7 PM.”  I must resist! #noinboxpost7
Somehow threw my back out while sleeping.  Now awake and in pain. Ouch.
4 am awakeness. meh.
Intended to do &quot;4 easy miles&quot; with Maurice Dumit (my physio, and friend), wound up being my fastest 10K yet. 6.52 miles, 8:23 pace.
Looking for completely transparent but fibrous paper (or something to draw on). Must be see-through at a distance - on a window. Thoughts?
So, there&#39;s this book I wrote. And it comes out next year, probably in April. Pretty cool. http://implicitbody.net&nbsp;

Congratulations to the totally awesome work of UWM Design students (and Faculty!) at their show last night on Grand Avenue. Well done!
Not gonna be ready to leave in 2 weeks! &amp; my &quot;work-holiday&quot; is really &quot;work-while-away.&quot; Sigh. At least there&#39;s art + old friends in Joburg.

Jetlag. Awake at 3. Maybe I can empty my inbox and try to get some paperwork done?… I&#39;d rather be sleeping, reading, eating....
I believed everyone, but I&#39;m still boggled at how easy the #kinect makes interactive/CV art with #openFrameworks. #updatingEverythingNow #OF
Thinking positive: #jetlag means more time to play with #openFrameworks
Does anyone know when the Mac OSX #openFrameworks will work in 10.8 without 10.6 quicktime dependencies? I tire of rebooting… #OF
@angus_davidson sadly, the 64-bit OF does not work with video and the 10.6 sdk breaks with the most recent versions of Xcode + OSX!
Up at 4:30 AM. Better than 3, like the last few days. And I can prepare my class. But man, it&#39;s cold here! #needCoffee
@angus_davidson yeh, worked for Xcode 4.4, not 4.5. And a few other things work very differently, so had to go back + forth. Not worth it!
Did anyone out there get nice video of #tweetsinspace in New Mexico? we&#39;re mixing down a new vid, + could really use performance footage!
Pure Nonie. H/T Jim Charlespic.twitter.com/zzOxGvik
@angus_davidson yeh, I got copying the sdk etc working with 4.4, then with the upgrade to 4.5, no more. one more downgrade was the straw...
It&#39;s really, really, really cold (and snowy) out there. Did I mention I miss South Africa sometimes? #Milwaukee

Just a few more (massive) things to deal with, then off to hang out with my sister Samantha and her family next week!
peeve of the day: subconscious=popular culture term regarding perception + focus. unconscious=pyschoanalytic term about our minds + thought.

Daddy, I&#39;m cold.
You are wet and therefore cold; if you get dry, you will not be cold.
That&#39;s wautological.
OMG I love you.
The problems with TED. I agree with all of this…. We need to talk about TED | Benjamin Bratton http://gu.com/p/3yfvc/tw&nbsp; via @guardian
Happy New Year, everyone. May we all have the strength to give one another a little more.
Heading to Epcot to scuba w/ some sharks - overpreparing for my marine scanner art, or just crazy? You decide. #compressionism #implicitbody

Working on Kickstarter campaign w/ Scott Kildall + US Artists fundraiser w/ Jessica Meuninck-Ganger. Exciting new projects! # yay #art
In next 2 days, I must review grad student apps between various Nonie outings + meetings. Is it me, or did weekends stop existing long ago?
Two incontrovertible things: Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real, and the Wall Street Journal is a Political Rag http://bit.ly/y1jyVI&nbsp;

Just got back from @creativecap (Creative Capital) info session here in Milwaukee. AMAZING. I &lt;3 Ruby Lerner. We need 20 more just like her.
Not a very good night&#39;s sleep. Mind blazing with ideas, anxieties and excitement of varying degrees. Coffee. More coffee.

Productive morning.
This has been a really long day. And I still have several hours of work to go. Good thing I like art/teaching/reading/writing so much.

Crazy days! Art and writin and teaching and all....
I know Situationist is meant to be capitalized. What about Relational Art / Aesthetics? (Other than when I&#39;m referring to the book.)
&quot;art is always both a limitation and a magnification&quot;

Getting warmer. Getting warmer!... No, not Milwaukee - that&#39;s actually getting colder. I just mean I&#39;m almost done with my book!

dangerous thought... RT @charlottefrost: I keep accidentally direct messaging people, for my next trick I&#39;ll public message a private tweet!
@charlottefrost @artcity sorry to miss it, too. tho hanging single volunteer piece this morning was far more work than it should&#39;ve been.

@charlottefrost @artcity  I have Charlie and the Choco factory tix with nonie at 4. Could do before that with her, if possible?
