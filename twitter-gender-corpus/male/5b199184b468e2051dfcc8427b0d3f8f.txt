@RakkAttackk Be happy that they aren&#39;t working you from day 1!
@katiedel LOL, cool, I&#39;m looking forward to it working.
@drewwilson @gmph @dialoggs is that all? =)  looking forward to it!
@tchaten Well you are seeing ramifications now. If I tell you I am gonna sock u in the face last week, it hurts a lot more when I do it 2day
@atjamie @erikamkay but how did that person send you a text with a dead phone? I am calling iPhone with either mac or iPad iMessage. No?
@juviwhale ANOTHER BARAKA! Oh no!!!!
@BrianNorgard you are not alone my friend.  Check it out: http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2012/05/31/how-to-double-user-retention-with-push-notifications-urban-airship-shares-best-practices/&nbsp;…
@atjamie lol. It&#39;s not that bad is it???
@bryanmwolfe easiest money of your life
@AndyNico_ FINALLY! I was shocked by your previous decision. Welcome back!
@kimkimcachoo @andynico_  lol. Yes you will be welcomed to the club too!
@RakkAttackk NOOOOO!  Are you kidding me. Freaking Tamme
@BrentDirks WOW. That is crazy!
@reneritchie Can you preorder for a different carrier and port your number without ever walking into a store and getting new iPhone shipped
@asronline @atjamie @christyxcore COOL! Now you can airplay movies on TV, make awesome keynotes for class, &amp; run it for next 10 yrs! Oh wait
@julipuli @atjamie and the new iPhone is getting even bigger.  Apple is not doing your pockets any favors ;)
@BrianNorgard latest rumors are pre-orders start Friday morning.
is panorama only available on iPhone 5 and the new iPod touch?  If it works on iPod Touch&#39;s A5 chip, why won&#39;t it run on 4s?
Confirmed: iPhone 4S WILL feature panorama mode, but not iPhone 4
If I am switching from AT&amp;T to Verizon and want to port my number do I preorder from Apple or Verizon?
@reneritchie I read your posts about it (marketing, mass appeal, yada, yada, yada)…but I am still shocked!
@reneritchie Give me iPhone 6, iPhone LTE, anything…but not the iPhone 5!!! ;)
Why can&#39;t I put in my phone number for Messages on mac like I can on my iPad.
@jeff148apps I read your post about switching…but what about porting 2 number&#39;s onto 1 verizon share everything plan. Need to use VZN site?
@jeff148apps Does this worry you:http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/13/3328492/iphone-5-simultaneous-voice-data-verizon-sprint&nbsp;…
@atjamie check email
@llofte I finally found one reason the move to Verizon is not perfect:http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/13/3328492/iphone-5-simultaneous-voice-data-verizon-sprint&nbsp;…
@llofte ah, i see you guys already discussed this. Alright I&#39;ll see you on the verizon side =)
@jeff148apps Ah…I thought I was gonna see a great Jeff response and then see a troll go nuts.  RESPOND!!! It&#39;s fun..for us at least =)
@christyxcore LOL. Sounds expensive.
@VZWSupport Thanks for the reply. I am bringing my wife with me, and I want to join my family on a share everything plan. How should I do it
@vzwsupport also was sad to learn no talk &amp; text for iPhone 5 on LTE. Any chance this will be changed or permanent hardware issue
@christyxcore That&#39;s why I hate kickstarter.  I love the ideas, but products never ship on time and for iPhone always too late
@reneritchie umm nice picture on iPhone 5 preorder forum post…can I come to your next slumber party. LOL
Riddle me this Batman: On Verizon, if I am on a phone call (voice) then hit FaceTime (data) does that work? Or do I have to hang up?
@christyxcore Did tests. We discovered if you initiate it,  it&#39;s seamless, but it hangs up on other person and calls them back as FaceTime
@christyxcore I tested it with Dom. He had Verizon. It still works okay. It&#39;s better on AT&amp;T but this is fine.
@reneritchie @drbarnard @att @verizon @llofte it&#39;s got me thinking twice. But I am ready to &quot;rule the air&quot;
@christyxcore umm maybe, @robinrhys would know better than me. We&#39;ll check tomorrow
@atjamie Y U NO AIM?  If you&#39;re up I am gonna make you work!
@atjamie where are the excitement posts! apple store down, att has countdown taking over site, verizon is ready to rock…lets get excited!
@AndyNico_ CALL.IN.SICK
@AppAdvice duh. We are waiting to order new lightning connectors!
@christyxcore get me some too!!!!
@robinrhys att?
@VZWSupport Very happy! I ported 2 number.Only issue was it asked me for my account info from att, but didn&#39;t ask on 2nd line for wife.
@vzwsupport is that going to be an issue? we have diff account numbers. Confirm #: 9210925800132005
@kimkimcachoo @christyxcore LOL, i said respectfully!  I bought the 4s off contract so I could jump ship for iPhone 5 =) Nice job C!
@VZWSupport Oh really?  I was able to put in her number? Can we fix it now, or do I have to wait tip I get it?  I am happy to be here!
@atjamie we have never been affected this long.  I am really worried.  Do what you can!
@AndyNico_ view on computer…they look awesome
@VZWSupport I know the no simult. voice/data is b/c of how apple built phone,but it&#39;s really a huge issue w/ imessage &amp; navi any fix?LTEvoip
@llofte how did they tell you? they called you?
@llofte why would they move his and not yours? And how did you get that date? No more Verizon?
@jeff148apps yes sir!  We are now part of  @vzwsupport Though I did I lot of tests and iMessages not being delivered during call is BIG neg.
@jeff148apps first @llofte now you!  You guys are all leaving me to go to Verizon by myself =(
@atjamie DAWSON&#39;S CREEK is my favorite show of all time. No joke. And I am in love with Joey Potter.
@erondu happy birthday buddy!
@gruber It was very easy to do using verizon&#39;s site.  I was skeptical, but it was a pleasant experience. Also ported from AT&amp;T
@llofte call back. Be angry. Ask for manager.
@llofte My experience is reps in store will just call customer support anyway. I would keep trying.  This is ridiculous!
@drbarnard It&#39;s even worse.  Even if the results were right and there were no bugs, that is an awful interface to try to find anything
@erondu on what?
@erondu oh LOL, I got married 4 yrs ago…but somehow I lost the connection on FB so I reeded it today.
@atjamie Okay, I just checked what I can afford for you from there.  I&#39;ll get the &quot;free ground shipping&quot; please mark it off the registry
@Book_Dork @atjamie lol
.@mittromney I&#39;ve unsubscribed from your mailing list 3x &amp; I still get emails. WTF, man? cc @FECupdateshttp://cl.ly/image/260r3J3W0Q2i&nbsp;…
Everyone please try the new appbump feature in AppsGoneFree 2.0. Huge updatehttp://getapp.cc/app/470693788&nbsp;
Wow, AppsGoneFree is ranked #19 in the entire iPad App Store. Thanks for everyone who is supporting AppBump!http://getapp.cc/app/470693788&nbsp;
@reneritchie What about the HTML 5 App Store update?  I am pretty worried about it. you okay with it?
Finally! Your phone # receives iMessages on your phone, iPad, &amp; Mac. Unless you are on Verizon and on a phone call. Then iPad &amp; Mac only
@jeff148apps Yeah when you hang up, they come in.
@jeff148apps If it was already received on iPad or mac (and read), because the message window was open, it won&#39;t come in new, just slide in
@jeff148apps I picked Verizon, but I am really worried about it!
@jeff148apps Jeff, if you know anyone to share with Verizon can be pretty cheap. I am sharing with 3 other low data users, should save $$
@Mark_T_Willard ask Michael what about the &quot;Jordan Rules&quot; his era. He says it didn&#39;t happen.
@macmixing CULT OF MAC? where we at
Remember when we used to text in tweets and @ replies? Me neither, I started Twitter with Twitterific
@atjamie You know how much I hate that stupid iPhone 5 name.  #callitiPhone6
@reneritchie @atjamie NO NO NO!  3G makes sense. 1st phone with 3G support! You can call this iPhone LTE, just not 5!
@reneritchie @atjamie iPhone(1st one), iPhone 3G (first w/ 3g), 3gs (like 3g but fast, 4 (4th one), 4s (like 4 but better), 5 (explanation?)
@reneritchie @atjamie iPhone high-five!!! I like it! Let&#39;s call it that =)
@reneritchie @atjamie wow Bad reason! I&#39;ll drop it now.But you never answered about App Store app.Everyone talking maps, App Store is issue!
@reneritchie @atjamie oh just your experience.You think it&#39;s an issue, or you think I&#39;ll get used to it. Feels like so many steps back.
@atjamie @reneritchie Jamie, that&#39;s where you go everyday from 8-3 right?
@christyxcore @reneritchie @atjamie haha, I like that
@reneritchie Very true, I don&#39;t know why they did those cards in search. But whole thing is slow and buggy
@atjamie @reneritchie LOL, nicely played.  Okay too much tweeting…back to work!
Siri doesn&#39;t like apps, that start with &quot;app.&quot; So if you want Siri to launch AppAdvice you have to say &quot;launch app appadvice&quot; #protip
@OurielOhayon It&#39;s true! Your app works because it starts with apps,not app.Our AppsGoneFree app works fine, it&#39;s just the singular word app
@OurielOhayon  Siri uses natural language. So appadvice becomes app advice. &quot;App&quot; throws Siri off. AppsFire becomes apps fire. &quot;Apps&quot; is ok
@OurielOhayon LOL. I think that would just confuse Siri. #notworthit
@RippsUp i can&#39;t get that to work. It&#39;s really working? It says &quot;open appadvice&quot; in text but response is &quot;cannot find an app named advice&quot;
@lsliang2001 What&#39;s bothering you?
@lsliang2001 iOS 6
@lsliang2001 I hate the new app store, aside from all the bugs, the search is killing me larry!
@lsliang2001 you getting iPhone 5?
@KanePoehlman What do you mean?
@jeff148apps yay! I have a verizon friend…@llofte ditched us ;)
@KanePoehlman I sent you the code via DM
@AndyNico_ @christyxcore In the US we can leave a note and have it dropped off, not over there?
@christyxcore SHHH, don&#39;t give away our secrets ;)
@AndyNico_ angel? halo over head?
@christyxcore midnight? It&#39;s 1AM!!!! Midnight was so an hour ago
@reneritchie you&#39;re crazy! I can&#39;t believe you were up for your slumber party last week and didn&#39;t preorder!
@reneritchie Hanging with apple folk is cool but up all night in the freezing cold waiting in a line?!
@HeatherBlansett @christyxcore GOOD LUCK!!! Let us know how it goes. You going black or white?
Sorry to everyone I direct message&#39;d nonsense too. Does these people really have nothing better to do. Anyway, sorry!
@jeff148apps NOOO!!! What changed your mind?
@jeff148apps LOL, by unknown you mean fear of no data while on phone calls, I have fear of &quot;unknown&quot; too
I was so sure the black iPhone 5 was the way to go... I was wrong!
@christyxcore for what? you can&#39;t change color with applecare can you?
@chasesclouds Nothing wrong with black, white is just so HOT!!!
@reneritchie @atjamie LOL, well I couldn&#39;t be part of an Apple site without complaining about meaningless Apple stuff right?
@KarenSFreeman I love it, but in photos the black looked so much better (i thought) but in real life I love white
@chasesclouds I too had the white 4S.  I never use it case. Iove the beauty of the device…but we&#39;ll see how scratches go.
@jeff148apps is that really doable. With upgrade eligibility and such?
@chasesclouds How.wouldn&#39;t it be a return rebuy…and if so how fast does my eligibility come back?
Does anyone want to trade a new Verizon iPad for an AT&amp;T iPad one? 32GB model. My AT&amp;T new iPad is literally mint condition.
Thanks for everyone who helped. White iPhone 5 obtained.pic.twitter.com/TML899ws
@christyxcore lol. Sorry, still in the iPhone 5 fam with you! Non iPhone 5 optimized apps look a lot better on black though.
@jeff148apps It would have been super easy to swap if bought it from apple.But since I didn&#39;t I had to go to Vzn. Return then buy at apple
@tchaten I thought so too. But in person I loved the white.
@RakkAttackk make sure you change your password. They have there password.
@tchaten how far along are you. Any scheduled release? preview teaser?
@atjamie eh, I don&#39;t think passbook warrants it…At least not now. But isn&#39;t the idea it pops up for you? No need to launch?
@tchaten cool good luck! you publishing in iBookstore?
@tchaten cool, good luck. We&#39;ll check it out at macworld!
@atjamie At least you have @AppAdvice app on your homescreen, unlike someone else I know…named @christyxcore and yes iPhone 5 support coming
@christyxcore LOL..okay okay…just busting your chops.
@llofte There&#39;s an app for that:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grubhub-food-delivery-takeout/id302920553?mt=8&nbsp;…
@christyxcore I miss myspace. I don&#39;t care how much people make fun of the awful page designs. Cool you got your &quot;space&quot; to personalize.
@christyxcore and no &quot;news feed&quot; meant endless navigation to all your friend&#39;s pages to see what was new. Less efficient, more fun.
@christyxcore Not to sound like a creeper, but it was more acceptable to hit up friends of friends…okay now i sound like a creeper #stopping
@jeff148apps Oh yeah, well I am playing with something cool too, but I&#39;m not telling either. J/k it&#39;s an iPhone 5 =)
@VZWSupport Has Verizon released a statement on their plans &amp; estimate timelines for VoLTE? Bringing simultaneous voice/date &amp; hd calls
@tchaten any idea how much data you used? I know you are unlimited, but that would be great to know
@tchaten I remember video, forgot findings…do you remember old findings?
@christyxcore link
&quot;Some part of me wishes I had gotten white instead&quot; - @christyxcore discussing her choice oh iPhone color.
@christyxcore lol. I know. Busting your chops for the 2nd time today!
Email I got Apple is giving me an iPad 3. 1 problem…there is no such thing as an iPad 3 &amp; I think Apple knows thathttp://cl.ly/image/1J0x0t312p1h&nbsp;…
@erondu those appetizers look pretty bomb though
@asronline you can get a ton of free space pretty easy… i have 24GB…hit me up if you want tips
@christyxcore lol…at least he&#39;s realistic..wait he said they&#39;d beat out windows 8, nevermind
@christyxcore maybe it&#39;s stuck in apple approval process like AppsGoneFree... Oh wait, just kidding.
@christyxcore I know! Thus the &quot;just kidding.&quot; I guess I shouldn&#39;t quit my day job. LOL.
@RakkAttackk lets make a trade happen for your sorry RBs..
@RakkAttackk how about sjack, c. johnson and nelson…for fitz, witten, and moreno? You aint playing sjack or CJ anyway?
@rakkattackk I am just scared sjack will get hurt…and ur loaded with RBs
@rakkattackk witten is big upgrade at TE too…had an awful game last week but lots of targets and he is healthy now
@RakkAttackk Sent a trade, added heath miller. Let me know what you think. If you don&#39;t like why not
@christyxcore standby eh?
@christyxcore seriously. Bring me something cool on Friday!
@christyxcore oh booo! I thought it was for the 5
@christyxcore I was talking about the box that showed up today. I didn&#39;t see the bags
@bryanmwolfe AppsGoneFree has been sitting there a week already =(
@christyxcore I do love my phone with no case. My dream is to find a nice case one day but I have never seen one that convinced me to use
@christyxcore you&#39;re right.My iPhone 5 is lasting forever with 1%.But that&#39;s not good that it is not calculating the percentages correctly.
@chpwn Siri repeats the last thing she said to you when you say &quot;what&quot; ... So you must have asked to send a tweet previously.
@HeatherBlansett @kimkimcachoo @bryanmwolfe all i am saying is despite how fast it seems, these devs probably all submitted over a week ago
@JulieVaughn @cluckstv @viddy @sol @aolmobile Nice, I will have the @AppAdvice team cover this for you!
@julievaughn @cluckstv @viddy @sol @aolmobile Ah, not out yet! I will cover it once it goes live. Keep us posted =)
@Book_Dork Send us a link!  I wanna see
@reneritchie  InstaPockaBility’d nice!
@Book_Dork nice!!! Congrats.
@bryanmwolfe you still posting your thoughts on it today?
@JulieVaughn @cluckstv @viddy @sol @aolmobile Here&#39;s the writeup we did: http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/09/aol-releases-clucks-a-cross-between-viddy-and-draw-something&nbsp;… Good luck!
AppsGoneFree featured on ABC San Diego local newshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe6bUjecAzU&nbsp;…
@jeff148apps Thanks…We are not from San Diego &amp; They got appbump wrong, but it&#39;s still cool. LOL
@christyxcore no one does buy full price and extend your contract. Do they? Hello iPhone 6
Nice placement advertising by Apple “@pdparticle: Samsung wants you to purchase an iPhone 5 too. http://i.imgur.com/vLlrC.jpg&nbsp;”

@chasesclouds when it comes to tea, I always vote Pepsi
@chasesclouds @heatherblansett Hmm tough call, both are great. Coke did have MJ (http://youtu.be/UfwzizFhUIU&nbsp;) but Pepsi hadhttp://youtu.be/aYywiQ3-6To&nbsp;
@kimkimcachoo @heatherblansett @chasesclouds an epic battle that is guaranteed to end in thirst quenchingpic.twitter.com/ripiJ9Wr
@kimkimcachoo @heatherblansett @chasesclouds The whole &quot;next generation&quot; campaign was brilliant and gave coke a run for their money in 80s
@kimkimcachoo @heatherblansett @chasesclouds I love the current Pepsi font. And last Xmas coke did white cans? Ruining their iconic branding
@kimkimcachoo @heatherblansett @chasesclouds yeah as far as marketing - Pepsi wins.Coke won in mass distribution, especially internationally
I love &quot;carmageddon&quot; it&#39;s the only time I ever get to average more than 80mph for an entire hour long drive
I hate college football. So many huge plays. You are never safe
@kimkimcachoo they closed a freeway for the weekend and everyone is freaking out.

@jeff148apps It&#39;s Monday!!! Waiting on the exciting news you teased last week
@jeff148apps You mean like what 4KB is today?
@jeff148apps LOL. In that case congrats on composing a tweet at all!
@chasesclouds LOl, not til lunch!
I figured it out. The black iPhone 5 always looks like it&#39;s in a case due to the smoked out side covering. I&#39;ve always loved iPhones naked.
@christyxcore it does. Put it on the table so the screen is facing up. Look at it. See the black casing around the side.
@christyxcore lol where is @Noobocity for the &quot;no dude&quot; love
@christyxcore @kimkimcachoohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVIOBtGVbvs&nbsp;…
@HeatherBlansett @juviwhale congrats!! We are lucky to have you =)
@jeff148apps WOW. Huge news.  Congrats. I hope you&#39;re still going to be a big part of the team over there!
@jeff148apps Nice! I am excited then.  Our bets were a new app, or maybe an exclusive about what you erased under NDA a couple weeks ago
@LifeInTents Yeah but the problem on iOS is you don&#39;t notice any practical difference. Test att &quot;4g&quot; vs let in real life setting. no diff.
@jeff148apps No dodgers, no angles? Come on…Next year is the year of Los Angeles Baseball =)
@jeff148apps Everyone here is crazy and they wanna give the AL MVP to  Trout over Cabrera…is this a national thing or just crazy LA?
@HeatherBlansett you reminded me! I need I cancel my gym subscription.
@christyxcore wow..I just looked, didn&#39;t realize how far it dropped… ranks: 213 paid iPhone 170 free iPhone, 235 paid iPad,198 free iPad
.@christyxcore But then again, Draw Something is still making more than 1/2 a million every month by my estimates
Rachel gives one of the most moving love speeches of all time, then says she&#39;s done? Doesn&#39;t make sense. And yes that was a #glee tweet!
@msleamichele that was actually pretty amazing performance. I didn&#39;t know you had it in you. Not just for #glee that was all-time level.
anyone?  Trade a Verizon LTE iPad for an AT&amp;T one?  These share everything plans messed everything up...
@jenienb @buzzfeed lol. That is crazy. He must have been pretty pissed that Joey chose Pacey and he wants everyone to forget about it
@kimkimcachoo try clicking on any file and pushing space bar. It&#39;s the best
@kimkimcachoo get an Apple TV too. So you can AirPlay stuff to your TV!
@christyxcore @kimkimcachoo it&#39;s not out yet right? Only alpha stuff and they submitted yesterday right? So like 2 more weeks to wait
@mnengle &quot;that is dress is becoming on you...but then again if I was on you...&quot;(rest is NSFW!)
The things I miss about jailbreak is becoming less &amp; less, but not being able to forward voicemail is a big thing I really miss. #additapple
@dubbalubagis LOL, yes you are!
@superpixels that is not native in iOS. Only thing I can think of is someone using the new iOS 6 framework in their app on a ss within app
@jenienb better than being at work!
@superpixels looks like an iPhone app in landscape, so can&#39;t be App Store, can you ask what app that&#39;s in?
@superpixels Pretty cool. I wonder if they hard coded it or used the new framework. I have not seen that in action yet. I&#39;ll check
@148Apps to answer that, we need to define the need for http://app.net&nbsp; in the first place. As for Tapbots they made a lot of money!
@jenienb r u going to xx concert in 2 weeks?
@jenienb LOL, yeah i am still kinda young. I need 2 tickets. any extras?
OMG! My cracked iPhone 5 screen was actually covered under warranty.It&#39;s called single hairline crack and is covered.no tricks or apple care
this now means I have had 3 iPhone 5&#39;s in under 3 weeks. Black exchanged for white, then cracked screen replaced…some can&#39;t even get 1?
@rsmoz I dropped it from about 1 foot off the ground and a small crack appeared. looked like under glass: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1060998&nbsp;…
@rsmoz from black to white? Within 30 days from apple not hard at all. Just bring it in and they swap it. Assuming they have stock.
@rsmoz for crack screen, genius bar appt
@jeff148apps LOL…of course I am, I&#39;m a friend of Jeff Scott&#39;s! That&#39;s all I tell them every time
@jenienb LOL…I thought your mom said you could jack the upgrade.
@jenienb I still can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t Glee….you should catch up and watch...
So it is confirmed by me. All 3 iPhone 5&#39;s I had all came with a crazy robotic Siri voice. After restore she sounded like herself.
@atjamie Wasn&#39;t it jay betting money it wasn&#39;t happening. LOL
@kimkimcachoo Nice.  Yeah none in Los Angeles. Even Sprint is sold out ;)
@christyxcore At least you have wifi at home, LOL.  If you can only pick LTE while out or at hime, while out is better
@atjamie @macmixing LOL…Dam if it&#39;s your life we&#39;re talking about, I would at least get Apple Care PLUS!
@atjamie can u find me asap please
“@Behance: All QR codes look alike…until now. ILLUSTRATED QR CODES: http://on.be.net/QTlgRr&nbsp;” yup that&#39;s me retweeting a prompted tweet

The best part of the presidential debates is watching the candidates fight the mediators.
@superpixels Hey you&#39;re in our neck of the woods!  If you wanna grab a drink or some lunch with some dudes from @AppAdvice let me know!
@tchaten you are finally believing in the product that I heard was &quot;fake fake fakety fake&quot; lol /@ndyfaust

@jeff148apps yes!!! @juviwhale @dubbalubagis and in are in San Jose. Tyler will be live blogging. We&#39;ll look for you.
I think Apple just killed the iPad. I don&#39;t see the the value proposition of the 4th gen iPad mini, I know @reneritchie will disagree
Just posted a photo http://instagr.am/p/RIsIEosUF6/&nbsp;
@jeff148apps @juviwhale @dubbalubagis lunch?
@reneritchie have you heard any more info on how much apple will charge to replace broken iPhone 5 screen?Saw your post last month.Any info?
@reneritchie yes. No apple care+
@chasesclouds my phone is okay. I didn&#39;t crack it. Just trying to get info so I can give people buying advice on apple care
@macmixing I been working on mine all day:pic.twitter.com/2ltIvERL
@jeff148apps Sadly I think it&#39;s more of a bad supply issue than a cagy demand issue
@AndyNico_ @jeff148apps naw it was nov. 2nd here

@jenienb rdio has a much nicer UI. I like it more. Get on it!
@w1kedZ @atjamie I don’t wanna lose my text messages though, so i always restore from backup
@reneritchie But boy is it a brutal attack in the US.  To the layman it’s a very compelling argument
@jenienb is it good music?
@christyxcore ohh a negative tweetbot tweet from Christine, I didn’t think I’d see the day.
@AndyNico_ power for the future’s sake!  If you have more powerful hardware developers will push those limits. They are aware of constraint
@jenienb fail to see how that&#39;s a bad thing? Would you really prefer the weather in NY right now.
@jenienb I missed it. What he say
@jenienb a better tweet?
LAKERS!!!!
@HeatherBlansett you will surely be able to. It is just an iPad 2 with diff form

@WCHamilton lol! My first ever pocket tweet!
@macmixing WOW!  You take a picture of the iOS family and don’t include the grand daddy of it all, the iPHONE!!!!!!!!!!
@jenienb says my tweets are too boring. So here is something really interesting. It actually is the best thing you will see twitter ever.
@jenienb damn I ran outta characters. Oh well.
@jenienb sure I will if u really make it!!! Don&#39;t be jealous of @robinrhys
@drewwilson lol to you just seeing this now! Weird they decided to change that single screen right? No functional change, weird design redo
@susbelief I didn&#39;t know you were on Twitter!  That&#39;s so cool. I look forward to tweeting with you =)
@susbelief BTW, everyone likes the Tweetbot app for their iPhone.  I still prefer the official twitter app. But Tweetbot is nice on the mac
Long election line and the janitor who is supposed to unlock this place isn&#39;t here yet. #whencanwevoteonline

@AndyNico_ how much did you get for it. I’d love to move my 32GB LTE (AT&amp;T) model
@jenienb it&#39;s raining in LA. You happy now? I hate it
Just saw someone get pulled over on the 10 for being in new &quot;fastrrack&quot; lane #lahotlane

@Book_Dork we have wayyyy more readers than that.
They gotta pull RG3.
@kimkimcachoo he&#39;s not helping at all. You see his face when he limped those 9 yards? And the throws are awful. He&#39;s  great but hurt
Idiots. I don&#39;t know anything and I knew he should not be in the game.
@dubbalubagis too soon. Give the poor guy a day before bashing him.
@dubbalubagis plus he&#39;s gotta better head than Vick. I see him more like mcnabb if anything
@juviwhale no way
@atjamie @juviwhale lol. That comes outta your paycheck. Or should I say paychecks. Multiple paychecks.
Nice way to dispel the rumor. I still think its true though “@kobebryant: The mamba vs d12 !! It&#39;s on lol pic.twitter.com/n63PDX5Y”

@erondu wait you live in SF now? We are in palo alto. Come hang out
@RakkAttackk lol. They are a game away from missing playoffs and you want the MVP. It&#39;s not like he was playing with the best center
@jenienb lol. I am thinking they need all the help they can get against the spurs. And that&#39;s what u notice? No beautiful Layann comment!
@jenienb Janan says &quot;good save&quot; pretty smooth ms. bottle. Laker shirt is a PJ. FYI twitter is 140
@jenienb look what I am sitting on right now though :/pic.twitter.com/ozcPUKMG0X
@jenienb hahaha. Better yet you come be the photographer. You should visit us up here. U know u got time!
@jenienb oh no?! Not for a few years then?
@jenienb oh wait you mean the actual finals?! I thought you meant a single playoff series. You are never coming! Why is Nadia moving here
@jenienb lol. That&#39;s a real hash tag. I just checked. What a diss to Howard. No way he&#39;s signing again
Growing apart is okay...as long as you do it together. #originalquotes
@atjamie okay then. My baby is 0. But don&#39;t ask me again until next year because the answer won&#39;t change!
@RakkAttackk why? For real. Not trying to fight but they play the right way and lebron is a joy to watch play. Regardless if u like him

@dantoml press don&#39;t get tickets to WWDC. They just invite some press to the keynote. Not the actual sessions, which are for devs
@macmixing not really. Because it seems no matter what they do to revenue, the stock wants to keep going south.
@dantoml those are devs with developer accounts. Apple invites press for free to keynote. Those who also have Dev accounts can buy for 1,600
@dantoml maybe the answer is only let devs who have app in store go? To weed out press buying? But is that fair to upcoming devs?
@chasesclouds sorry to hear. Saying a prayer for her now.

@dubbalubagis you really rather watch spurs pacers?

@markgurman nice job today.
@juviwhale I would not go that far. But then again, I have not installed it yet.
@bryanmwolfe why? Because they showed color iPod touches? Remember iPod touch is the game / music device. Makes sense to show it on iPod.
What&#39;s everyone&#39;s reaction to apple shoving the iTunes radio into iTunes instead of a separate radio app?
iTunes is already too clunky and stuffing the radio in it makes it just a lost feature of iTunes, rather than a serious product/service.

@SHAQ check out an app made by a huge fan who left the Laker bandwagon for how they treated you. http://getapp.cc/app/470693788&nbsp; tweet if you like it
@atjamie you are up? Isn&#39;t it 6am
@liftapp @superpixels and be really really good at basketball and you&#39;ll figure it out =)
Everyone who got burned on Facebook IPO: Your shares are now safe as #fb has just passed $38. Now get out while you can! Fool me once...
@drewwilson lol to your reply.
@jeff148apps thought you were talking Tony Romo there for a second.
@superpixels just had same issue. Restart comp fixed for me.
@UMAD @BrianNorgard what&#39;s app worked for paid. Yes free now but was paid for years at #1 in App Store
Need a cheap gsm iPhone. Any model is fine. Any suggestions? (Yes I will check craigslist and eBay need other suggestions)
@WCHamilton yeah I will pay for it! Thanks
That moment when you yell YOLO, but then realize you&#39;re a Hindu...
@UMAD wow. But I thought iOS was supposed to be intuitive. #missforstall
@SteveStreza I am sure you have one in you. Come on...
@nabeel @rsmoz that&#39;s the point though. They had long history of social impact and still only a fraction of cost of other companies. Nuts
Lol I just got an email: a spam/scraper site wants to sell my data back to me
@jenienb are you going to that thing in moorpark today?
@jenienb you FAIL! I was showing my mom how fast you are at this stuff. But no response!!!
@jenienb lol. Okay that&#39;s acceptable I guess. We&#39;re in cerritos so we will pass. Have fun. My mom says hi
@jenienb did you look this up yet http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10235261/Inside-the-Hyperloop-the-pneumatic-travel-system-faster-than-the-speed-of-sound.html&nbsp;…
@jenienb yeah.
@macmixing you tweeting from theatre?
@DanaRebecca how come the GLEE20 promo code is not working? Is there a new code? I have to buy a 5 year anniversary gift for my wife! #help
@chasesclouds why did he call you?
@chasesclouds oh I see! What did you ask him
@markgurman I want those 4 mins of my life back. Lol
@SteveStreza there are worse things that you can be spammed about. #You&#39;veGotMoney!
@reneritchie nice job on your quick and dirty mockup of gold iPhone 5 last week. Looks like you nailed it
@erondu Which app?
Remember when everyone was obsessed about Adobe Flash coming to the iPhone and how it wouldn&#39;t work without it...
@thesamlytle what you doing?!
@markgurman hope they are on an unlimited plan.
Amazing how fast the human mind adapts. I am having trouble using iOS 6. Keep searching in the URL field and pulling down for spotlight.
@UMAD lol. I am commenting on how amazing the human mind is, not iOS 7. We can adapt to anything, even if it&#39;s lesser.
@UMAD all in all iOS 7 is fine. I do think iOS 6 is more beautiful and easier to use.
@UMAD like how many users are gonna figure out how to forward a text message now?You have to guess hold the bubble, then hit more then check
@UMAD it&#39;s true.If there a grand reason.Like design works on watches, cars, and tvs better okay. I Just hope it&#39;s not change for change sake
@UMAD lol! You caught me. The fact that my entire business is centered around only iOS apps is a front!
@superpixels yeah but they didn&#39;t go backwards. Yes iOS 7 icons may improve but point is Mac 1.0 icons were best we saw at time #missiOS6
.@superpixels BTW I am not convinced that this looks better than even Mac 1.0, looks very similar to me #missiOS6pic.twitter.com/SnJ50yrGOq
@reneritchie I need the help of a Canadian. please DL http://appsto.re/us/CEJdC.i&nbsp; &amp; use it to follow any app to the app store. Does it work?
Silicon Valley quote of the day #1:  &quot;Why does our company have to have revenue?&quot;
Silicon Valley quote of the day #2: &quot;I would never work there. You have to work every hour you&#39;re there&quot;
@reneritchie okay thanks. Got a couple for emails both from CA saying it loads App Store but not proper app. Trying to diagnose if all CA
@reneritchie @gruber @sdw @gte I have always loved the ideas in this article from 2 years ago by a former writer:http://appadvice.com/appnn/2011/07/nintendos-barely-treading-water-but-apples-got-extra-life-jackets&nbsp;…
@OurielOhayon hiring is harder than both!
@OurielOhayon well I guess if you wanna overpay for rookies with inflated egos it&#39;s not too bad.
@OurielOhayon so you officially here now?
@superpixels this is how I feel about android =)
@alanwarms new app coming?
@drewwilson did you see these bad boys:pic.twitter.com/wnJmKU29GI
@OurielOhayon Would be great if it was all fake, but looks like too much evidence against the gold iPhone. #China
@OurielOhayon Did you think the new app icons were Apple taste? And thesepic.twitter.com/1rnXVEHdt5

@gruber you do realize football started today right?
the excitement over this event is sky high…very weird..even my non-apple crowd are tweeting about it and highly anticipating it.
@AndyNico_ Yeah that&#39;s why I am surprised. I guess people who follow this stuff know what we&#39;re getting and it&#39;s all kinda meh…
@AndyNico_ Thing that kinda sucks is if they had something really new to show it could turn perception over night, #NextYear
@AndyNico_ Let&#39;s throw the full TV in there too! I think 2014 it will finally happen!
@AndyNico_ But retina mini this year no?
@Objective_Neo Download IPA.  Same way for iOS 6.
@chasesclouds why not order on 13th
@chasesclouds Nope. I didn&#39;t really see the benefit.  Fingerprint is cool but not useful enough, same with camera upgrades
@OurielOhayon I guess it&#39;s not too similar but I just got an email from tracking company named AppFireworks. I immediately thought of you
@markgurman @stroughtonsmith I am getting crashes on iPhone 5 still as well. #RadarTime
“@windowsphone: 8 megapixels is still just 8 megapixels. See what you can do with 41: http://newwp.it/1b1Yc0M&nbsp; #timetoswitch to #WindowsPhone”

August and Everything After... That is all #countingcrows
You know that feeling when cool people start following you and then you feel the need to tweet something cool? #idontthinkthiscounts
@UMAD you my friend are fast!
@DuaneKinsey caught me red handed. Lol
@jano5sauce @LOUlSTOPS it&#39;s there. Look under &quot;classic&quot;

@reneritchie so how do you get slow mo clip off the device?
@timburks how so?
My iPhone is now in the same state as I am. Should have by tomorrow!
@christyxcore even though white is still the prettiest I wanted a change so 32gb space gray
@markgurman thanks!
So apparently I am the weird one for not knowing the channel H2. As @juviwhale explained it&#39;s &quot;history channel 2... you know like MTV2&quot;
@arnoldkim where does it say there is a change to the IAP policy? Do you just mean because users don&#39;t spend iap money within 24 hours?
@arnoldkim @markgurman if we send user on day 1 to a freemium app. Then again on day 3. And on day 3 the user buys iap from day 1 - counts?
@davidingle @MackFlavelle if you are on a @Verizon iPhone you still tell yourself that daily. #notalkandsurf #sucks
Can&#39;t believe Apple would approve this app. Clearly infringing....OnePassword by mattia scevolahttps://appsto.re/us/cwRBP.i&nbsp;
@everpix my wife and I share a photo library. Any chance we can add 2 Facebook and 2 gmail accounts? Would pay twice. #nolongeroneperson
@everpix awesome! Again I would be happy to pay twice. Not trying to save money it just doesn&#39;t make sense for us to have 2 unique accounts
@IURabah no critical govt services stay open
@christyxcore I sold an 8gb iPhone 4 today for $150. That&#39;s my suggestion.
I just disabled touch ID. I know...it is so amazing for everyone else and I must be programming it wrong. I never used a pass code before so
@christyxcore ah weird. That phone is so old. I had Verizon too
@reneritchie how are you doing this. When I keep the button pressed down I get Siri. When I just rest my finger on button I get touchid
@reneritchie oh I see If you disable Siri. Interesting. Not sure which I like better. I am getting more &quot;try again&quot; this way
@superpixels That&#39;s what I love about the App Store on iOS7, especially on the iPad. Good thing my business doesn&#39;t rely on that. Oh wait.
@markgurman Cool new app is out if that helps your boredom:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tick/id683780016?mt=8&nbsp;…
@phillryu I thought I was the only one! I gave up on the damn thing and went pass code-less
@Objective_Neo I don&#39;t follow? What are the facts
I guess I won&#39;t be seeing @OfficialSisQo  here:pic.twitter.com/2nHO7o3t7C
@UMAD lol. You called it. Only in #SanFrancisco
@UMAD well pier 39. Close enough.
WTF is apple doing keeping the iPad 2 around? 2+ year old hardware same price as new retina mini, only 100 less than 3 model newer iPad air
@superpixels point is not the iPad 2 sucks. Point is iPad 2 is old and it&#39;s not cheap at 400. Should have kept iPad 4 at that price
@arnoldkim New affiliate IAP policy has my total commission down over 60%.  Man, I never thought freemium would hurt this bad. You ok?
I still like official twitter app but tweetbot is the best use of #ios7 that I have seen
@arnoldkim Sent you a couple of emails over the weekend.  The last one I just sent you is most telling. Let me know if you want to chat!
@BrentDirks did not know that. Should do a post.

What happened to brydge ipad keyboard case. Is that still a thing? Work for iPad Air?
@w1kedz I know. But site not updated forever. I never hear about it. No mention of iPad air.

@OurielOhayon affiliate revenue?
@OurielOhayon That’s great! we are down 60% since the IAP policy change.
@alariccole eh, it’s a move that matches their latest moves, but I don’t think it’s the right direction.

@phillryu try &quot;Many Thanks&quot; it&#39;s a good one that has the same friendly vibe.
@phillryu Besides if you don&#39;t say exactly what the person wants to hear &quot;cheers&quot; sounds like  &quot;F OFF&quot; many thanks doesn&#39;t do it as much
@phillryu In all honestly if someone doesn&#39;t like what you have to say I don&#39;t think the salutation matters. Cheers it is! 

Many thanks =)
@reneritchie the most important question....what did you watch?!
Looking for an iPhone case that makes my black 5s look like a 5c. Anyone know any?
@AndyNico_ lol. It&#39;s a pretty phone. It looks like it has a case on it already. Should be easy to replicate
@superscientific @macmixing which networks? Sprint?
@macmixing hey dom. I want a case to make my black 5s look like a 5c. You see anything?
@macmixing I just think it looks HOT!!!
@jeff148apps I don&#39;t think they are getting app of the week. They just went to freemium they didn&#39;t go free
Yuphttp://youtu.be/MtN1YnoL46Q&nbsp;
What&#39;s the Lakers record with Kobe?
The @appsfire website is really nice. It&#39;s Pretty and well done. Good job team.

@AppAdvice @iHaz3 oh I thought I responded. We may use it when we update appadvice but we have not gotten far enough to decide.
@AppAdvice @iHaz3 feel free to share it if you like
@iHaz3 @AppAdvice oh okay. I will send you a code later today

@UMAD @stokefire flickering!
@stevekovach there&#39;s not a new one is there?
@reneritchie it&#39;s the little tweaks. Voicemail forwarder, contact pics in the contacts list, screen recording are few that come to mind
@reneritchie unlike most iPhone users I still use the phone app a lot, the voicemail forwarder is essential. But waiting on JB via @saurik
@AndyNico_ FESTIVUS FOR THE REST OF US!http://youtu.be/55fI9_D9lTs&nbsp;
@AndyNico_ see also the huge appadvice festival we did 2 years ago in its honor  http://appadvice.com/appnn/tag/days-of-festivus-giveaway&nbsp;…
@Objective_Neo they have rollback to previous version also.
@kimkimcachoo CONGRATS!!!
@mattfriz Hey Matt, looked over your site...I&#39;d love to discuss Angular with you with you. Email? I am mahmoud@appadvice.com
@launchticker @Jason @zynga that my friends is a publicity grab. It&#39;s a great idea too, people will talk about this.
@Objective_Neo sounds like Asem, lol
@RakkAttackk Be happy that they aren&#39;t working you from day 1!
@katiedel LOL, cool, I&#39;m looking forward to it working.
@drewwilson @gmph @dialoggs is that all? =)  looking forward to it!
@tchaten Well you are seeing ramifications now. If I tell you I am gonna sock u in the face last week, it hurts a lot more when I do it 2day
@atjamie @erikamkay but how did that person send you a text with a dead phone? I am calling iPhone with either mac or iPad iMessage. No?
@juviwhale ANOTHER BARAKA! Oh no!!!!
@BrianNorgard you are not alone my friend.  Check it out: http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2012/05/31/how-to-double-user-retention-with-push-notifications-urban-airship-shares-best-practices/&nbsp;…
@atjamie lol. It&#39;s not that bad is it???
@bryanmwolfe easiest money of your life
@AndyNico_ FINALLY! I was shocked by your previous decision. Welcome back!
@kimkimcachoo @andynico_  lol. Yes you will be welcomed to the club too!
@RakkAttackk NOOOOO!  Are you kidding me. Freaking Tamme
@BrentDirks WOW. That is crazy!
@reneritchie Can you preorder for a different carrier and port your number without ever walking into a store and getting new iPhone shipped
@asronline @atjamie @christyxcore COOL! Now you can airplay movies on TV, make awesome keynotes for class, &amp; run it for next 10 yrs! Oh wait
@julipuli @atjamie and the new iPhone is getting even bigger.  Apple is not doing your pockets any favors ;)
@BrianNorgard latest rumors are pre-orders start Friday morning.
is panorama only available on iPhone 5 and the new iPod touch?  If it works on iPod Touch&#39;s A5 chip, why won&#39;t it run on 4s?
Confirmed: iPhone 4S WILL feature panorama mode, but not iPhone 4
If I am switching from AT&amp;T to Verizon and want to port my number do I preorder from Apple or Verizon?
@reneritchie I read your posts about it (marketing, mass appeal, yada, yada, yada)…but I am still shocked!
@reneritchie Give me iPhone 6, iPhone LTE, anything…but not the iPhone 5!!! ;)
Why can&#39;t I put in my phone number for Messages on mac like I can on my iPad.
@jeff148apps I read your post about switching…but what about porting 2 number&#39;s onto 1 verizon share everything plan. Need to use VZN site?
@jeff148apps Does this worry you:http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/13/3328492/iphone-5-simultaneous-voice-data-verizon-sprint&nbsp;…
@atjamie check email
@llofte I finally found one reason the move to Verizon is not perfect:http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/13/3328492/iphone-5-simultaneous-voice-data-verizon-sprint&nbsp;…
@llofte ah, i see you guys already discussed this. Alright I&#39;ll see you on the verizon side =)
@jeff148apps Ah…I thought I was gonna see a great Jeff response and then see a troll go nuts.  RESPOND!!! It&#39;s fun..for us at least =)
@christyxcore LOL. Sounds expensive.
@VZWSupport Thanks for the reply. I am bringing my wife with me, and I want to join my family on a share everything plan. How should I do it
@vzwsupport also was sad to learn no talk &amp; text for iPhone 5 on LTE. Any chance this will be changed or permanent hardware issue
@christyxcore That&#39;s why I hate kickstarter.  I love the ideas, but products never ship on time and for iPhone always too late
@reneritchie umm nice picture on iPhone 5 preorder forum post…can I come to your next slumber party. LOL
Riddle me this Batman: On Verizon, if I am on a phone call (voice) then hit FaceTime (data) does that work? Or do I have to hang up?
@christyxcore Did tests. We discovered if you initiate it,  it&#39;s seamless, but it hangs up on other person and calls them back as FaceTime
@christyxcore I tested it with Dom. He had Verizon. It still works okay. It&#39;s better on AT&amp;T but this is fine.
@reneritchie @drbarnard @att @verizon @llofte it&#39;s got me thinking twice. But I am ready to &quot;rule the air&quot;
@christyxcore umm maybe, @robinrhys would know better than me. We&#39;ll check tomorrow
@atjamie Y U NO AIM?  If you&#39;re up I am gonna make you work!
@atjamie where are the excitement posts! apple store down, att has countdown taking over site, verizon is ready to rock…lets get excited!
@AndyNico_ CALL.IN.SICK
@AppAdvice duh. We are waiting to order new lightning connectors!
@christyxcore get me some too!!!!
@robinrhys att?
@VZWSupport Very happy! I ported 2 number.Only issue was it asked me for my account info from att, but didn&#39;t ask on 2nd line for wife.
@vzwsupport is that going to be an issue? we have diff account numbers. Confirm #: 9210925800132005
@kimkimcachoo @christyxcore LOL, i said respectfully!  I bought the 4s off contract so I could jump ship for iPhone 5 =) Nice job C!
@VZWSupport Oh really?  I was able to put in her number? Can we fix it now, or do I have to wait tip I get it?  I am happy to be here!
@atjamie we have never been affected this long.  I am really worried.  Do what you can!
@AndyNico_ view on computer…they look awesome
@VZWSupport I know the no simult. voice/data is b/c of how apple built phone,but it&#39;s really a huge issue w/ imessage &amp; navi any fix?LTEvoip
@llofte how did they tell you? they called you?
@llofte why would they move his and not yours? And how did you get that date? No more Verizon?
@jeff148apps yes sir!  We are now part of  @vzwsupport Though I did I lot of tests and iMessages not being delivered during call is BIG neg.
@jeff148apps first @llofte now you!  You guys are all leaving me to go to Verizon by myself =(
@atjamie DAWSON&#39;S CREEK is my favorite show of all time. No joke. And I am in love with Joey Potter.
@erondu happy birthday buddy!
@gruber It was very easy to do using verizon&#39;s site.  I was skeptical, but it was a pleasant experience. Also ported from AT&amp;T
@llofte call back. Be angry. Ask for manager.
@llofte My experience is reps in store will just call customer support anyway. I would keep trying.  This is ridiculous!
@drbarnard It&#39;s even worse.  Even if the results were right and there were no bugs, that is an awful interface to try to find anything
@erondu on what?
@erondu oh LOL, I got married 4 yrs ago…but somehow I lost the connection on FB so I reeded it today.
@atjamie Okay, I just checked what I can afford for you from there.  I&#39;ll get the &quot;free ground shipping&quot; please mark it off the registry
@Book_Dork @atjamie lol
.@mittromney I&#39;ve unsubscribed from your mailing list 3x &amp; I still get emails. WTF, man? cc @FECupdateshttp://cl.ly/image/260r3J3W0Q2i&nbsp;…
Everyone please try the new appbump feature in AppsGoneFree 2.0. Huge updatehttp://getapp.cc/app/470693788&nbsp;
Wow, AppsGoneFree is ranked #19 in the entire iPad App Store. Thanks for everyone who is supporting AppBump!http://getapp.cc/app/470693788&nbsp;
@reneritchie What about the HTML 5 App Store update?  I am pretty worried about it. you okay with it?
Finally! Your phone # receives iMessages on your phone, iPad, &amp; Mac. Unless you are on Verizon and on a phone call. Then iPad &amp; Mac only
@jeff148apps Yeah when you hang up, they come in.
@jeff148apps If it was already received on iPad or mac (and read), because the message window was open, it won&#39;t come in new, just slide in
@jeff148apps I picked Verizon, but I am really worried about it!
@jeff148apps Jeff, if you know anyone to share with Verizon can be pretty cheap. I am sharing with 3 other low data users, should save $$
@Mark_T_Willard ask Michael what about the &quot;Jordan Rules&quot; his era. He says it didn&#39;t happen.
@macmixing CULT OF MAC? where we at
Remember when we used to text in tweets and @ replies? Me neither, I started Twitter with Twitterific
@atjamie You know how much I hate that stupid iPhone 5 name.  #callitiPhone6
@reneritchie @atjamie NO NO NO!  3G makes sense. 1st phone with 3G support! You can call this iPhone LTE, just not 5!
@reneritchie @atjamie iPhone(1st one), iPhone 3G (first w/ 3g), 3gs (like 3g but fast, 4 (4th one), 4s (like 4 but better), 5 (explanation?)
@reneritchie @atjamie iPhone high-five!!! I like it! Let&#39;s call it that =)
@reneritchie @atjamie wow Bad reason! I&#39;ll drop it now.But you never answered about App Store app.Everyone talking maps, App Store is issue!
@reneritchie @atjamie oh just your experience.You think it&#39;s an issue, or you think I&#39;ll get used to it. Feels like so many steps back.
@atjamie @reneritchie Jamie, that&#39;s where you go everyday from 8-3 right?
@christyxcore @reneritchie @atjamie haha, I like that
@reneritchie Very true, I don&#39;t know why they did those cards in search. But whole thing is slow and buggy
@atjamie @reneritchie LOL, nicely played.  Okay too much tweeting…back to work!
Siri doesn&#39;t like apps, that start with &quot;app.&quot; So if you want Siri to launch AppAdvice you have to say &quot;launch app appadvice&quot; #protip
@OurielOhayon It&#39;s true! Your app works because it starts with apps,not app.Our AppsGoneFree app works fine, it&#39;s just the singular word app
@OurielOhayon  Siri uses natural language. So appadvice becomes app advice. &quot;App&quot; throws Siri off. AppsFire becomes apps fire. &quot;Apps&quot; is ok
@OurielOhayon LOL. I think that would just confuse Siri. #notworthit
@RippsUp i can&#39;t get that to work. It&#39;s really working? It says &quot;open appadvice&quot; in text but response is &quot;cannot find an app named advice&quot;
@lsliang2001 What&#39;s bothering you?
@lsliang2001 iOS 6
@lsliang2001 I hate the new app store, aside from all the bugs, the search is killing me larry!
@lsliang2001 you getting iPhone 5?
@KanePoehlman What do you mean?
@jeff148apps yay! I have a verizon friend…@llofte ditched us ;)
@KanePoehlman I sent you the code via DM
@AndyNico_ @christyxcore In the US we can leave a note and have it dropped off, not over there?
@christyxcore SHHH, don&#39;t give away our secrets ;)
@AndyNico_ angel? halo over head?
@christyxcore midnight? It&#39;s 1AM!!!! Midnight was so an hour ago
@reneritchie you&#39;re crazy! I can&#39;t believe you were up for your slumber party last week and didn&#39;t preorder!
@reneritchie Hanging with apple folk is cool but up all night in the freezing cold waiting in a line?!
@HeatherBlansett @christyxcore GOOD LUCK!!! Let us know how it goes. You going black or white?
Sorry to everyone I direct message&#39;d nonsense too. Does these people really have nothing better to do. Anyway, sorry!
@jeff148apps NOOO!!! What changed your mind?
@jeff148apps LOL, by unknown you mean fear of no data while on phone calls, I have fear of &quot;unknown&quot; too
I was so sure the black iPhone 5 was the way to go... I was wrong!
@christyxcore for what? you can&#39;t change color with applecare can you?
@chasesclouds Nothing wrong with black, white is just so HOT!!!
@reneritchie @atjamie LOL, well I couldn&#39;t be part of an Apple site without complaining about meaningless Apple stuff right?
@KarenSFreeman I love it, but in photos the black looked so much better (i thought) but in real life I love white
@chasesclouds I too had the white 4S.  I never use it case. Iove the beauty of the device…but we&#39;ll see how scratches go.
@jeff148apps is that really doable. With upgrade eligibility and such?
@chasesclouds How.wouldn&#39;t it be a return rebuy…and if so how fast does my eligibility come back?
Does anyone want to trade a new Verizon iPad for an AT&amp;T iPad one? 32GB model. My AT&amp;T new iPad is literally mint condition.
Thanks for everyone who helped. White iPhone 5 obtained.pic.twitter.com/TML899ws
@christyxcore lol. Sorry, still in the iPhone 5 fam with you! Non iPhone 5 optimized apps look a lot better on black though.
@jeff148apps It would have been super easy to swap if bought it from apple.But since I didn&#39;t I had to go to Vzn. Return then buy at apple
@tchaten I thought so too. But in person I loved the white.
@RakkAttackk make sure you change your password. They have there password.
@tchaten how far along are you. Any scheduled release? preview teaser?
@atjamie eh, I don&#39;t think passbook warrants it…At least not now. But isn&#39;t the idea it pops up for you? No need to launch?
@tchaten cool good luck! you publishing in iBookstore?
@tchaten cool, good luck. We&#39;ll check it out at macworld!
@atjamie At least you have @AppAdvice app on your homescreen, unlike someone else I know…named @christyxcore and yes iPhone 5 support coming
@christyxcore LOL..okay okay…just busting your chops.
@llofte There&#39;s an app for that:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grubhub-food-delivery-takeout/id302920553?mt=8&nbsp;…
@christyxcore I miss myspace. I don&#39;t care how much people make fun of the awful page designs. Cool you got your &quot;space&quot; to personalize.
@christyxcore and no &quot;news feed&quot; meant endless navigation to all your friend&#39;s pages to see what was new. Less efficient, more fun.
@christyxcore Not to sound like a creeper, but it was more acceptable to hit up friends of friends…okay now i sound like a creeper #stopping
@jeff148apps Oh yeah, well I am playing with something cool too, but I&#39;m not telling either. J/k it&#39;s an iPhone 5 =)
@VZWSupport Has Verizon released a statement on their plans &amp; estimate timelines for VoLTE? Bringing simultaneous voice/date &amp; hd calls
@tchaten any idea how much data you used? I know you are unlimited, but that would be great to know
@tchaten I remember video, forgot findings…do you remember old findings?
@christyxcore link
&quot;Some part of me wishes I had gotten white instead&quot; - @christyxcore discussing her choice oh iPhone color.
@christyxcore lol. I know. Busting your chops for the 2nd time today!
Email I got Apple is giving me an iPad 3. 1 problem…there is no such thing as an iPad 3 &amp; I think Apple knows thathttp://cl.ly/image/1J0x0t312p1h&nbsp;…
@erondu those appetizers look pretty bomb though
@asronline you can get a ton of free space pretty easy… i have 24GB…hit me up if you want tips
@christyxcore lol…at least he&#39;s realistic..wait he said they&#39;d beat out windows 8, nevermind
@christyxcore maybe it&#39;s stuck in apple approval process like AppsGoneFree... Oh wait, just kidding.
@christyxcore I know! Thus the &quot;just kidding.&quot; I guess I shouldn&#39;t quit my day job. LOL.
@RakkAttackk lets make a trade happen for your sorry RBs..
@RakkAttackk how about sjack, c. johnson and nelson…for fitz, witten, and moreno? You aint playing sjack or CJ anyway?
@rakkattackk I am just scared sjack will get hurt…and ur loaded with RBs
@rakkattackk witten is big upgrade at TE too…had an awful game last week but lots of targets and he is healthy now
@RakkAttackk Sent a trade, added heath miller. Let me know what you think. If you don&#39;t like why not
@christyxcore standby eh?
@christyxcore seriously. Bring me something cool on Friday!
@christyxcore oh booo! I thought it was for the 5
@christyxcore I was talking about the box that showed up today. I didn&#39;t see the bags
@bryanmwolfe AppsGoneFree has been sitting there a week already =(
@christyxcore I do love my phone with no case. My dream is to find a nice case one day but I have never seen one that convinced me to use
@christyxcore you&#39;re right.My iPhone 5 is lasting forever with 1%.But that&#39;s not good that it is not calculating the percentages correctly.
@chpwn Siri repeats the last thing she said to you when you say &quot;what&quot; ... So you must have asked to send a tweet previously.
@HeatherBlansett @kimkimcachoo @bryanmwolfe all i am saying is despite how fast it seems, these devs probably all submitted over a week ago
@JulieVaughn @cluckstv @viddy @sol @aolmobile Nice, I will have the @AppAdvice team cover this for you!
@julievaughn @cluckstv @viddy @sol @aolmobile Ah, not out yet! I will cover it once it goes live. Keep us posted =)
@Book_Dork Send us a link!  I wanna see
@reneritchie  InstaPockaBility’d nice!
@Book_Dork nice!!! Congrats.
@bryanmwolfe you still posting your thoughts on it today?
@JulieVaughn @cluckstv @viddy @sol @aolmobile Here&#39;s the writeup we did: http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/09/aol-releases-clucks-a-cross-between-viddy-and-draw-something&nbsp;… Good luck!
AppsGoneFree featured on ABC San Diego local newshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe6bUjecAzU&nbsp;…
@jeff148apps Thanks…We are not from San Diego &amp; They got appbump wrong, but it&#39;s still cool. LOL
@christyxcore no one does buy full price and extend your contract. Do they? Hello iPhone 6
Nice placement advertising by Apple “@pdparticle: Samsung wants you to purchase an iPhone 5 too. http://i.imgur.com/vLlrC.jpg&nbsp;”
@alyssabernal you&#39;re on!  Going now
@alyssabernal Small 11&quot; macbook air, but you can see it here:http://cl.ly/image/0P1G1c2t1W0W&nbsp;…

@alyssabernal Thanks! Good luck, I will keep voting =)
Non-apple tweet for my girl @jenienb
@JailbreakCon wrote an article @AppAdvicehttp://apadv.co/QmYYai&nbsp;
@chasesclouds when it comes to tea, I always vote Pepsi
@chasesclouds @heatherblansett Hmm tough call, both are great. Coke did have MJ (http://youtu.be/UfwzizFhUIU&nbsp;) but Pepsi hadhttp://youtu.be/aYywiQ3-6To&nbsp;
@kimkimcachoo @heatherblansett @chasesclouds an epic battle that is guaranteed to end in thirst quenchingpic.twitter.com/ripiJ9Wr
@kimkimcachoo @heatherblansett @chasesclouds The whole &quot;next generation&quot; campaign was brilliant and gave coke a run for their money in 80s
@kimkimcachoo @heatherblansett @chasesclouds I love the current Pepsi font. And last Xmas coke did white cans? Ruining their iconic branding
@kimkimcachoo @heatherblansett @chasesclouds yeah as far as marketing - Pepsi wins.Coke won in mass distribution, especially internationally
I love &quot;carmageddon&quot; it&#39;s the only time I ever get to average more than 80mph for an entire hour long drive
I hate college football. So many huge plays. You are never safe
@kimkimcachoo they closed a freeway for the weekend and everyone is freaking out. We drive a lot in LA http://m.travelerstoday.com/articles/3208/20120929/carmageddon-2012-busy-los-angeles-freeway-closed-drivers-warned-to-stay-off-roads-carmageddon-ii-2-california-traffic-interstate-405-sepulveda-pass.htm&nbsp;…

@RakkAttackk what&#39;s up with tech?

@jeff148apps It&#39;s Monday!!! Waiting on the exciting news you teased last week
@jeff148apps You mean like what 4KB is today?
@jeff148apps LOL. In that case congrats on composing a tweet at all!
@chasesclouds LOl, not til lunch!
I figured it out. The black iPhone 5 always looks like it&#39;s in a case due to the smoked out side covering. I&#39;ve always loved iPhones naked.
@christyxcore it does. Put it on the table so the screen is facing up. Look at it. See the black casing around the side.
@christyxcore lol where is @Noobocity for the &quot;no dude&quot; love
@christyxcore @kimkimcachoohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVIOBtGVbvs&nbsp;…
@HeatherBlansett @juviwhale congrats!! We are lucky to have you =)
@jeff148apps WOW. Huge news.  Congrats. I hope you&#39;re still going to be a big part of the team over there!
@jeff148apps Nice! I am excited then.  Our bets were a new app, or maybe an exclusive about what you erased under NDA a couple weeks ago
@LifeInTents Yeah but the problem on iOS is you don&#39;t notice any practical difference. Test att &quot;4g&quot; vs let in real life setting. no diff.
@jeff148apps No dodgers, no angles? Come on…Next year is the year of Los Angeles Baseball =)
@jeff148apps Everyone here is crazy and they wanna give the AL MVP to  Trout over Cabrera…is this a national thing or just crazy LA?
@HeatherBlansett you reminded me! I need I cancel my gym subscription.
@christyxcore wow..I just looked, didn&#39;t realize how far it dropped… ranks: 213 paid iPhone 170 free iPhone, 235 paid iPad,198 free iPad
.@christyxcore But then again, Draw Something is still making more than 1/2 a million every month by my estimates
Rachel gives one of the most moving love speeches of all time, then says she&#39;s done? Doesn&#39;t make sense. And yes that was a #glee tweet!
@msleamichele that was actually pretty amazing performance. I didn&#39;t know you had it in you. Not just for #glee that was all-time level.
anyone?  Trade a Verizon LTE iPad for an AT&amp;T one?  These share everything plans messed everything up...
@jenienb @buzzfeed lol. That is crazy. He must have been pretty pissed that Joey chose Pacey and he wants everyone to forget about it
@kimkimcachoo try clicking on any file and pushing space bar. It&#39;s the best
@kimkimcachoo get an Apple TV too. So you can AirPlay stuff to your TV!
@christyxcore @kimkimcachoo it&#39;s not out yet right? Only alpha stuff and they submitted yesterday right? So like 2 more weeks to wait
@mnengle &quot;that is dress is becoming on you...but then again if I was on you...&quot;(rest is NSFW!)
The things I miss about jailbreak is becoming less &amp; less, but not being able to forward voicemail is a big thing I really miss. #additapple
@dubbalubagis LOL, yes you are!
@superpixels that is not native in iOS. Only thing I can think of is someone using the new iOS 6 framework in their app on a ss within app
@jenienb better than being at work!
@superpixels looks like an iPhone app in landscape, so can&#39;t be App Store, can you ask what app that&#39;s in?
@superpixels Pretty cool. I wonder if they hard coded it or used the new framework. I have not seen that in action yet. I&#39;ll check
@148Apps to answer that, we need to define the need for http://app.net&nbsp; in the first place. As for Tapbots they made a lot of money!
@jenienb r u going to xx concert in 2 weeks?
@jenienb LOL, yeah i am still kinda young. I need 2 tickets. any extras?
OMG! My cracked iPhone 5 screen was actually covered under warranty.It&#39;s called single hairline crack and is covered.no tricks or apple care
this now means I have had 3 iPhone 5&#39;s in under 3 weeks. Black exchanged for white, then cracked screen replaced…some can&#39;t even get 1?
@rsmoz I dropped it from about 1 foot off the ground and a small crack appeared. looked like under glass: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1060998&nbsp;…
@rsmoz from black to white? Within 30 days from apple not hard at all. Just bring it in and they swap it. Assuming they have stock.
@rsmoz for crack screen, genius bar appt
@jeff148apps LOL…of course I am, I&#39;m a friend of Jeff Scott&#39;s! That&#39;s all I tell them every time
@jenienb LOL…I thought your mom said you could jack the upgrade.
@jenienb I still can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t Glee….you should catch up and watch...
So it is confirmed by me. All 3 iPhone 5&#39;s I had all came with a crazy robotic Siri voice. After restore she sounded like herself.
@atjamie Wasn&#39;t it jay betting money it wasn&#39;t happening. LOL
@kimkimcachoo Nice.  Yeah none in Los Angeles. Even Sprint is sold out ;)
@christyxcore At least you have wifi at home, LOL.  If you can only pick LTE while out or at hime, while out is better
@atjamie @macmixing LOL…Dam if it&#39;s your life we&#39;re talking about, I would at least get Apple Care PLUS!
@atjamie can u find me asap please
“@Behance: All QR codes look alike…until now. ILLUSTRATED QR CODES: http://on.be.net/QTlgRr&nbsp;” yup that&#39;s me retweeting a prompted tweet

@w1kedZ LOL, I won&#39;t tell if you won&#39;t
@w1kedZ alright. Driving to lunch now. I will after
The best part of the presidential debates is watching the candidates fight the mediators.
@superpixels Hey you&#39;re in our neck of the woods!  If you wanna grab a drink or some lunch with some dudes from @AppAdvice let me know!
@tchaten you are finally believing in the product that I heard was &quot;fake fake fakety fake&quot; lol /@ndyfaust
@superpixels too bad! We&#39;re going to hold you to it next time.
@robinrhys lol! Boredom! Come work. We have appisodes to do woman! Until then, say hi to Joey for me. I miss her

@jeff148apps yes!!! @juviwhale @dubbalubagis and in are in San Jose. Tyler will be live blogging. We&#39;ll look for you.
I think Apple just killed the iPad. I don&#39;t see the the value proposition of the 4th gen iPad mini, I know @reneritchie will disagree
Just posted a photo http://instagr.am/p/RIsIEosUF6/&nbsp;
@jeff148apps @juviwhale @dubbalubagis lunch?
@reneritchie have you heard any more info on how much apple will charge to replace broken iPhone 5 screen?Saw your post last month.Any info?
@reneritchie yes. No apple care+
@chasesclouds my phone is okay. I didn&#39;t crack it. Just trying to get info so I can give people buying advice on apple care
@macmixing I been working on mine all day:pic.twitter.com/2ltIvERL
@jeff148apps Sadly I think it&#39;s more of a bad supply issue than a cagy demand issue
@AndyNico_ @jeff148apps naw it was nov. 2nd here
@christyxcore still time for black on first day…i ordered let so i gotta wait =(
It&#39;s a tweet costume!!!pic.twitter.com/C05liFjY
