I&#39;ve said it before &amp; I&#39;ll say it again: biologists shouldn&#39;t buy into hype surrounding publisher-hosted preprint servers - just use #arXiv
So is a CC-BY-ND/NC/no-reuse preprint that #bioRxiv offers still allowed to be published in a peer-review journal that accepts preprints?

w/ RWA &amp; SOPA, Elsevier+paywall publishers are only delaying their inevitable crash. Shareholders will be jumping ship soon
Now that I&#39;ve left Mendeley I can freely state that AAP+Elsevier are the biggest threats to science existing today
@pascal_biotech This is why (amongst other reasons)http://nyti.ms/y5hQFD&nbsp;

@drs1969 A big overlap in selection, with more US tv/films than lovefilm. Wld say absolute numbers abt equal for now
@drs1969 Wld add that Netflix killer app is actually the UX and rec engine. Kills all others.
