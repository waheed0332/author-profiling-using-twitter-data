@WatertownPatch thanks!
Pls. RT - anyone w/ pics of the finish line or surrounding areas can send directly to: boston@ic.fbi.gov #bostonmarathon #prayforboston
@WatertownPatch just called number and they said to email pics to boston@ic.fbi.gov 

Said its okay to pass email address along.
@michaelorlinski agreed. However, if you call the @FBIBoston tip line, this is what they&#39;ll tell you to. W/ this info u can avoid calling.
@michaelorlinski BTW email address to send pics to is boston@ic.fbi.gov. 

Thought you were responding to a more recent tweet.
@WatertownPatch  fortunately no. I had finished about 90 minutes beforehand and had left back bay by the time it all happened.
@michaelorlinski that account definitely looks fake. Would not put too much stock in it.
