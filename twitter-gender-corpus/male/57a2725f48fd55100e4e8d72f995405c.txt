@assad_from_that I&#39;m in the nosebleeds, but I know a sneaky spot in the 100&#39;s we can go to. They&#39;re $40 on stubhub, can&#39;t argue with that
@SkySports I&#39;m a British Pats fan at Metlife Stadium surrounded by  80,000 Jets fans and this first half was fantastic! Happy Thanksgiving!
Am I the only Patriots fan in a bad mood? We gave up 19 points to the effing Jets! That&#39;s terrible!
Withe the game on NBC, had to rock out to @Rodney_Harrison shirt tonight. It was a good call! #37pic.twitter.com/rfXXgvDE
My kidneys are aching from watching that Ricky Hatton KO. What a body shot!
If only Apollo Creed was still around to train Ricky Hatton and make another slow white boxer fast and black... #HattonComeback
@chrishancock7 *cough* NYC for 11 days *cough*
@timtheredmenace Fireman Ed got nothing on you. He only has one song!
In their last 4 games, the #Patriots have scored 190 points. More than the #Chiefs, #Cardinals, #Eagles &amp; #Jaguars have scored all season!
Thanks to WEEI for that stat
Should&#39;ve been a great day of sports given the rugby and football scores, but the tragedy in KC puts a black cloud over everything. Shocking
He might be 37 years old, but I defy anyone to show me another human being who can deliver a ball better than David Beckham #legend
@Jaurne @KristaMarieC In terms of delivery? Not even close to DB...

Hey Rex Ryan there is a difference between &quot;two great defenses&quot; and two awful, inept offenses. Today we saw the latter, not the former.
@assad_from_that The Film? Tom Hardy is badass!
@ChrisRav 12 Angry Men is one of the greatest films ever and 99% of it is 12 dudes talking around a table in the same room. I&#39;m credible.

@chris_brookes Haha. Good reference!
I&#39;m sure no one saw an RVP equalizer coming did they?!?!?
I genuinely did not know that Kieron Dyer was still on the face of the planet. He also defines irony today by scoring in injury time...
@NewYorkOwls QPR! I really thought he&#39;d retired or something, not seen anything from him for years!
I guess the &quot;Van Persie has only had one world-class season in his career&quot; critics will have to come up with something new...
In the stands at Upton Park, David Backham was thinking: &quot;I could have made that pass that Giggs made too&quot;
I think the #Jets have tied up &amp; hid the #Vikings and played in their place - Like what Frank Drebin did to Enrico Palazzo in The Naked Gun

@chris_brookes Its a decent view by my apartment!
Rob Ryan fired and the Jets need a defensive coordinator. It would probably be a disaster if he went there which I why I expect it to happen
@RobLoweSports For those of us who enjoy train wrecks, can you start the &quot;Rob Ryan to be new Jets defensive coordinator&quot; rumor?
@RobLoweSports Jets fans will see that as a vast improvement to what they saw this season
Now that Rex could hire his brother Rob as the DC, can he get his dad Buddy to be new GM? Or is that too much obesity for one team? #Jets
@MikeAndMike Any thought that helmets are the problem? Rugby players doesn&#39;t wear helmets and there are no concussion epidemics there
Tebow/Broncos references, Peyton&#39;s playoff struggles and Ray Lewis murder jokes seem to be dominating Twitter right now. I love the NFL!
@ChrisRav I&#39;ll be watching the Patriots bear the Ravens next week if that&#39;s ok with you?

@chris_brookes I interviewed Grant Hill at a charity soccer game in the summer. Legend!
@chris_brookes I don&#39;t know, he spent the game sat on the bench next to me which probably says a lot
Roman Abramovich probably thought it was a good idea for Southampton to fire Nigel Akins...
Once again, sports continues to be the most ridiculous and unpredictable reality TV show there is...
@DietmarHamann Nobody knows what to think, lots of conspiracy ideas. It&#39;s a crazy story!
@assad_from_that Where you watching the game?
@assad_from_that Yeah, I was planning a personal home viewing party. Then Ross came home and ruined it...
While all Patriots fans go to bed pissed off, Tom Brady will go to bed with this... 
 Well played.

Well there goes the Celtics season...Go Bruins!
@ChrisRav I thought it was an Ice Cube track
@piersmorgan Are you passing up a chance to compare Becks&#39; salary charity to Van Purstrings greed?
In 2013 #A-Rod could make $28m while not playing while #Beckham will play for free and donate his salary to charity. Respect Mr. Beckham.
@ChrisRav boooooooo!
@assad_from_that Have fun moving this weekend!
I pity anyone who chooses not to watch rugby, the 6 Nations is great entertainment year after year, especially a Lions year. C&#39;mon England!
@ImBrianColeman Is she hot?
@ImBrianColeman The people who bet &#39;over&#39; in the national anthem prop bet love her right now!
@KristaMarieC @imbriancoleman Aww, I got excited for a bit there
Contrary to what Ray Lewis thinks, I believe this years Super Bowl proves definitively that there is no god. At all.
@ImBrianColeman I was briefly in episode 2 &amp; 3 but should get some good screen time in episodes 8/9 if they use the right angles!
@ImBrianColeman Today&#39;s Good Wife I&#39;m getting some featured face time in a scene with Matthew Perry and Chris Noth. Start watching!

@sheepmanaled Scotty Gibbs better stay retired!!!
@southy_swfc I don&#39;t know, I streamed it on my laptop as I was out
@sheepmanaled Farrell is class, Tuilagi is a beast and Twelvetrees has a great name. No way you&#39;re doing anything through our midfield!
@timtheredmenace He did say &quot;goaltending&quot; but overall decent. Sounds more knowledgeable than Warren Barton already.
@timtheredmenace I love the Gus Johnson decision, he should be great by the World Cup. Barton offers nothing as a pundit though
Much respect to Robbie Rogers; Brave decision to come out as gay and walk away from football at 25. Good guy too. http://fb.me/2G6VcA57v&nbsp;
@GaryLineker Robbie Rogers hasn&#39;t officially &quot;retired&quot; just &quot;stepped away&quot;. At 25, could return

@NewYorkOwls At the Yorkshire chippy in the West Village, feeling good about it. 8-0 Wednesday. Wickham with 8. #UTO
@NewYorkOwls After seeing Taylor starting instead of Gardner I&#39;m changing my prediction to 8-5
@NewYorkOwls That&#39;s a typo mate, the 8 and 0 look very similar on my phone
@NewYorkRedBulls How do we know that&#39;s not last seasons shirt?
@T_Lee_ #IMustBeDreaming
@Joey7Barton He admitted he shot her, that&#39;s not in question. What is debatable is whether it was premeditated or accidental
@emb2b I used the word &#39;accidental&#39; in relation to the victim being his girlfriend as opposed an intruder not accidentally killing by firing
@GlennFyvie You do if you live in a country with a high murder/robbery rate and you think you have an intruder in your house
@GlennFyvie If Im in a dangerous country and thought an intruders broke in, I&#39;d defend myself rather than try to hide til the cops arrived
@GlennFyvie That said, it could all be bollocks and he knew who he was shooting at. I&#39;m not judging til we know all the evidence
@glennfyvie Just saying, it&#39;s not unusual in certain countries to open fire on a supposed intruder. Stories like that happen here often

Hey popstars, that&#39;s how the Star Spangled Banner is supposed to sound. Well done #Timbers fans.
@sheepmanaled I had a good laugh when that popped up on the screen. When do you get back to NYC?
This #RedBulls #Timbers game has 6-5 written all over it
Has a player ever been released from his contract during a game? Silvestre should be nervous...
@sheepmanaled It&#39;d be rude not to. Why the late departure?
On my goalkeeping coaching courses I&#39;m fairly sure we were supposed to teach keepers to push shots to the side rather than to other forwards
It&#39;s fair to say that Howard Webb certainly wouldn&#39;t have shown Nani a red card at Old Trafford if he was in charge
Bayern Munich fans watching this game thinking &quot;there&#39;s still time for United to win this&quot;
@Joey7Barton arguing with @justinbieber fans on Twitter &gt; @Joey7Barton arguing with @DietmarHamann on Twitter
@GlennFyvie He ran into Nani&#39;s leg from behind. Should have been a free-kick to United!
@NewYorkOwls He had is eye on the ball and was trying to control it when someone ran into his foot from behind!

@BigJohnTerry Based on what. The whole of the USA is sick to f-ing death of Tim Tebow. And Neymar?
Did everyone else enjoy their 6 emails from the Red Bulls today promoting their home opener? Kinda fortunate as I didn&#39;t notice the first 5
Tim Tebow is a taller faster Wes Welker if played in the slot. Give the Jets a call Bill! I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m joking or not... #Patriots
Which clown decided it was a good idea to schedule Red Bulls home opener at the same time as the England/Wales 6 Nations decider? 12:30pm?!?
@DFeuerstein I wanted to go the RBA, but I&#39;m not missing England live. A sensible kickoff time and I could have done both
@DFeuerstein I didn&#39;t blame RBNY, I asked which clown was responsible
@DFeuerstein Thanks!It&#39;s a youth soccer tournament weekend so the early kickoff will have stopped others from going who otherwise would have
@ThierryHenryNOT @timtheredmenace @DFeuerstein Well, I guess that&#39;s why man invented sports bars with 600 TV&#39;s, to watch two games at once
@RealSkipBayless And who is #1? Calvin Johnson. No surprise that the guys with the most targets have the most drops. Number accumulations
I think I&#39;m more sad to see Danny Woodhead leave than I was with Wes Welker #Patriots

Have fun at Red Bull Arena today everyone. Wish I could go but I have priorities. England playing for a Grand Slam is a priority.
My pet peeve of people turning the Star Spangled Banner into a pop song rears its ugly head. Did the Red Bulls learn nothing in Portland?
@sheepmanaled Ah shit, I just saw Steve Walsh is refereeing. Ill concede the game now
Has Steve Walsh had a stroke? He only seams capable of raising one of his arms today
USA sports fans, do yourselves a favor and switch on BBC America. This is sport at its greatest! #EnglandVsWales
@sheepmanaled But I still know the difference between your and you&#39;re!
@sheepmanaled But them again, English is a hard language to learn for you foreigners
I&#39;m not claiming to be England&#39;s greatest rugby tactical genius, but how are we not making a replacement on the front row of the scrum?
I sent that last Tweet 3 seconds too early!
@sheepmanaled With Walsh Man of the Match as predicted
@sheepmanaled I&#39;m also blaming Tuilagi for ruining two easy try scoring opportunities before the game got one sided
@sheepmanaled But to be fair to Wales, they fully took advantage of our errors and Walsh&#39;s gifts. Easier to take in a Lions year
I feel like a Welsh sheep right now. #raped
@sheepmanaled It&#39;s ok, I&#39;m going to pick myself up with a fun afternoon of a 6 hour defensive driver course

The Bruins just won at least. You can downgrade my suicide watch @sheepmanaled
St. Patrick&#39;s Day? Surely in the North East we should just start calling it St. Patrick&#39;s Month. #BecauseSomePeopleNeedAnExcuseToDrink
@sheepmanaled Bruins &amp; Celtics won so there was that. I think England losing was a bigger deal for you than me
@sheepmanaled I didn&#39;t. In Twickenham I would have been confident, Millennium Stadium is a tall order for a young inexperienced squad
@sheepmanaled I can&#39;t find the bit where I say England will win... Just saying we&#39;re a batter nation of people than everyone else. #Fact
@piersmorgan You&#39;d think people who follow you on Twitter would know the difference between your and you&#39;re by now!
@sheepmanaled When people celebrate you losing more than their own country winning it proves you&#39;re special!
@sheepmanaled You ever notice that no one hates shit, useless countries? Just dominant ones
@sheepmanaled You&#39;re absolutely right. It&#39;s perfectly rationale to judge an entire country based on its one bad game in the past few months
@sheepmanaled Oh, you mean when we won? In Ireland? How did you do against them?
@sheepmanaled So to summarize: Wales winning 6 Nations on points difference over a team with 320 less caps is the greatest achievement ever?
@sheepmanaled You&#39;ve been on social media about this game more than I was when we won the World Cup &amp; Boston won its last 7 cups combined!
@sheepmanaled My closing argument will be:
6 Nations &lt; Thispic.twitter.com/84jMOX5Fx4
No KG &amp; no Rondo but all The Greatest Team In The World (© ESPN) could manage was just 2 more points? #Celtics will get you in the playoffs!

@Mike_Ross7 It won Spain a World Cup and Euro Championship. Can&#39;t overreact on one game...
@actortrivia I&#39;m pretty sure it was Martin Sheen&#39;s role he turned down as he didn&#39;t was to spend months in the jungle
Well that was a crappy night of sports. Do I have time to watch the ESPN 30 for 30 &quot;Elway to Marino&quot; or get an extra 90 minutes of sleep...?
@chrishancock7 Just gpt booked on an overnight shoot of The Newsroom Thursday night. Don&#39;t know what cast members will be there yet though
@hhstharr1982 @mike_ross7 People wondered whether Pep was all that as a coach as he was surrounded by great players. That debate has ended
@hhstharr1982 @mike_ross7 I would be more articulate but I only have 140 characters
@Mike_Ross7 @hhstharr1982 I did write about Barca&#39;s injuries in my tweet but had to delete it as it didn&#39;t fit!
@Mike_Ross7 @hhstharr1982 Bayern are having one of the best season any team has ever had. I put £10 on Dortmund in Dec and want my £250 tho
The money I put on Dortmund in December looks better with every game!

“@NOTSportsCenter: #Jaguars select Luke Joeckel #2 overall. Our condolences to him, his family and loved ones. #NFLDraft”
If Jonesy was watching the draft, he&#39;d be saying &quot;massive chins Jets!&quot;
“@NOTSportsCenter: #Jets take Dee Milliner 9th. He is expected to take over for Darrelle Revis &amp; begin holding out immediately. #NFLDraft”
“@ChrisRav: Patriots again proving why they&#39;re the smartest organization at the #NFLDraft…picking up FOUR picks in a trade? Wow.” Yes sir!
Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft just high 5&#39;d and cracked up laughing. 4 picks in a deep draft for the 29th!?!?! Thanks Minnesota!
I&#39;d say the team that had the best first round of the #nfldraft was the Patriots - and they didn&#39;t even draft anyone. Very shrewd...
The last 10 days have compelled me to look for a Joe Andruzzi Patriots shirt. A hero in more ways than one
@Patriots It depends who we select, but to get four picks for the 29th in a deep draft like this is an A. I was delighted!
@NewYorkOwls Maybe @beinsportusa just have no interest in either common sense or ratings?
@newyorkowls @beinsportusa At least all the Barnsley fans in America will be happy. Oh wait, there aren&#39;t any. Aren&#39;t any in Barnsley either
Wait a second... Something interesting happened in Ohio?
Out of curiosity I looked at the baseball standings. Red Sox have the best recorded in all of baseball. F- you every one else. #BostonStrong
I&#39;m kind of scared to switch on ESPN right now, no idea what they may be talking about for the next few days...
And you all know Bill Belichick is taking #Tebow to the Patriots as a multi purpose RB/TE/WR so he can destroy the Jets twice a year
@DanCovello Jokes tend to be comical
@DanCovello I&#39;m only half sarcastic tho. He&#39;s fast and strong, good hands &amp; Bill loves versatile weapons like Hernandez who plays TE/WR/RB
@DanCovello He&#39;d be a project, but you could sign him to an incentive laden contract and cut him if his skill don&#39;t adapt to new position
@DanCovello And Bill loves to say f you to the Jets!
@WEEI Not as a QB, but in a role similar to Hernandez? Worth a try, the kids an athlete

Some of the superlatives on Thierry Henry&#39;s goal for Red Bulls last night have been way too much. A very good goal but not phenomenal
1. It was an overhead kick, not a bicycle
2. It was only 6 yards out
3. The cross was flicked on which took a lot of pace off it.
#HenryGoal
Don&#39;t get me wrong, great goal by a great player. But it&#39;s not even the best he&#39;s scored for RBNY &amp; there&#39;s been a lot better bicycle goals

@MarkFishkin Every game in Westchester (where RBNY TP have big presence) is 12-4. With an hours drive they have no chance, including me
@MarkFishkin I know, but why would they choose that time? Soccer families can&#39;t watch it on the East Coast and its 8am on the West!

I know BOD hasn&#39;t been tearing up Australia like he did 12 years ago, but to drop him from the 23 is blaspheme to #Lions fans!
BOD has been quiet, but had a guy inside him with barely any test experience at 12. He and Roberts complement each other very well #Lions
Croft and Youngs gone from the 23 is more shocking for me, most dependable 2 players in the lineout all tour. #Lions
Especially considering Hibbard f--ed up the crucial throw-in that could have won us the 2nd Test. #Lions
If #Lions win this 3rd Test, Gatland looks like a genius. Lose it and he will be vilified and ridiculed for his unpopular selections

@DFeuerstein And not Warren for serving up a beach ball for Napoli to crush?
@DFeuerstein You lost the game because your &#39;ace&#39; pitched terribly behind a AAA lineup, blaming an umpire on a bang bang play is weak...
@DFeuerstein I&#39;m pretty sure the Yankees have won games on close calls going in their favor, they tend to balance themselves out
@DFeuerstein I&#39;m just disgusted the Red Sox lost on Saturday. We should be sweeping a team that awful, even if our entire bullpen is on DL

I don&#39;t think we&#39;re good on paper either. “@Footy_Jokes: England good on paper 

Shit on grass”
@Mike_Ross7 @ChrisRav My point being Messi is a threat around the box, Ronaldo is a threat all over the field. Can control a game by himself
The whole Batkid thing is the most extravagant role play ever. Beating out &#39;The Game&#39; &amp; &#39;Shutter Island&#39;. Fantastic stuff by the whole city
@Mike_Ross7 @ChrisRav Which stats?
@Footy_Jokes Am I taking crazy pills or is that just the current England away shirt? I have one in my closet! You&#39;re not even trying anymore
@Mike_Ross7 @ChrisRav I didn&#39;t have stats, I asked you the question. Messi has a better team around him, best way to winning trophies

Fine effort against arguably the best sports team on planet earth right now. I love the look of this young England rugby team.

I should be pissed off with the #Patriots loss on #MNF but I&#39;m in a &#39;shrug my shoulders and say whatever&#39; kind if mood. 3 reasons...
1. Pats playing better every game, Ridleys fumble, Talib&#39;s arrogance &amp; Cam&#39;s two exceptional plays  = 24 point swing. Easily eradicated.
2. 66% of Pats losses came on plays the refs should have given Pats 1st &amp; goal at end of the game by the letter of the rules but didn&#39;t.
3. The Jets, Bills and Dolphins suck.
@ChrisRav It&#39;s the most important point. I&#39;m honestly not upset, tremendous game by 2 good teams came down to a little play here &amp; there
Dreadful &gt; f&#39;ing dreadful  = best of “@ChrisRav: I&#39;m assuming there are a negative number of songs on this album. pic.twitter.com/onshlng9Zi”
@ChrisRav Ridley&#39;s fumble was bigger and the non-sack on Cam. But a ref with the best view to throw a flag then have another say no???
@ChrisRav &amp; I did say to my Giant fan friend I was watching the game with &quot;this will probably end with an interception&quot; prior to final drive
@NewYorkOwls l&#39;ll be in a Boston this weekend, hopefully @PhoenixLanding2 will have @beINSPORTUSA online and show the Wednesday game!
@Mike_Ross7 Can&#39;t believe you think Zlatan is better than Cristiano
@Joey7Barton There is no money for coaches in England. Thats why many, like me, move abroad where we make good full time salaries
@TaylorTwellman @MLS @ESPNFC 1-England&#39;s population much higher than LA. 2-Little competition from other sports 3-Some teams average 3k fans

@timtheredmenace Sometimes my sarcasm isn&#39;t as obvious on Twitter!
Hey,  @SWFC, I&#39;m trying to watch the Patriots game right now.  Couldn&#39;t you have fired Jones yesterday so I could&#39;ve been paying attention?
I want the #SWFC the job and want Waddle, Sheridan &amp; Walker as my assistants. First job would be to sign David Hirst &amp; 10 Roland Nilsson&#39;s
@timtheredmenace Come on man, we&#39;re talking about one of the best left-backs on the planet over the last decade and Roy effing Miller
What a catch by Gronk! Owner of, by far, the biggest human hands I&#39;ve ever shook &amp; the lowest IQ I&#39;ve ever conversed with. Love him though!
Wait a second... Didn&#39;t #SWFC recall Agent Wilson a few months ago? Are we sending him out to ruin Barnsley or keeping him for ourselves?
@timtheredmenace He also cheated on one of the hottest women in Britain &amp; aparently likes sticking cellphones up his butt &amp; have people call

Thanks to the Patriots defense for the 27 fantasy points today!
Lots of highlights from #patriots #Ravens, this is #1 “@TomBradysEgo: LeGarrette Blount mocks Ray Lewis dance. (GIF) http://bit.ly/1a2pzmE&nbsp;”
@oliviamunn Ugh, I was there 3 days ago, my timing sucks.
@v0ltures More rings, first ballot HOFer and selflessly takes less salary on his contract so the team has more cap room. Remember that.
I love this, Tom Brady has everything in life but a high 5. Love his goofy &quot;LOL&quot; face too.http://bit.ly/195sMlc&nbsp;
@v0ltures Haha, way to bite! So I&#39;ll say $5000 that when both careers are over Brady has more rings, better stats and more HOF votes, deal?
Patriots 41 - 7 Ravens. And unless Nick Foles gets -11 points, I win my fantasy football championship too. Happy Sunday!

As far as opening 1:19 of games go, that&#39;s a pretty decent one for the Patriots

@NewYorkRedBulls How do we know that&#39;s not last seasons shirt?
@T_Lee_ #IMustBeDreaming
@Joey7Barton He admitted he shot her, that&#39;s not in question. What is debatable is whether it was premeditated or accidental
@emb2b I used the word &#39;accidental&#39; in relation to the victim being his girlfriend as opposed an intruder not accidentally killing by firing
@GlennFyvie You do if you live in a country with a high murder/robbery rate and you think you have an intruder in your house
@GlennFyvie If Im in a dangerous country and thought an intruders broke in, I&#39;d defend myself rather than try to hide til the cops arrived
@GlennFyvie That said, it could all be bollocks and he knew who he was shooting at. I&#39;m not judging til we know all the evidence
@glennfyvie Just saying, it&#39;s not unusual in certain countries to open fire on a supposed intruder. Stories like that happen here often
I&#39;m cheering for Cardiff to beat Wolves today @sheepmanaled but there will be no sheep shagging love at the Grand Slam decider. England!
Live pictures from Wembley as thousands of Swansea fans make their way to the stadium.

@sheepmanaled Yup, keeps us 5 points above Wolves!
@marinopatrickj And a good old &#39;too soon&#39; joke on Abraham Lincoln
Tom Brady agrees to 3 year contract extension for half his value to free up $15m of cap space for the Pats. Team player, all about winning!
ATTENTION EVERYONE! A lot of processed meat uses horse meat as filler! Stop being shocked by these &#39;revelations&#39; and get over it.
Thank you New York Daily News for finding new ways to kick #Jets fans while they&#39;re down.pic.twitter.com/cR48NrBb4c
@NewYorkOwls A choice of watching 1st half at @ffactoryny or watching full game on my laptop in a Starbucks. Got to go with the latter...
@ChrisRav The new #USMNT jersey is nice and the old logo is infinitely better than the current one. So there is that...
Hey popstars, that&#39;s how the Star Spangled Banner is supposed to sound. Well done #Timbers fans.
@sheepmanaled I had a good laugh when that popped up on the screen. When do you get back to NYC?
This #RedBulls #Timbers game has 6-5 written all over it
Has a player ever been released from his contract during a game? Silvestre should be nervous...
@sheepmanaled It&#39;d be rude not to. Why the late departure?
On my goalkeeping coaching courses I&#39;m fairly sure we were supposed to teach keepers to push shots to the side rather than to other forwards
It&#39;s fair to say that Howard Webb certainly wouldn&#39;t have shown Nani a red card at Old Trafford if he was in charge
Bayern Munich fans watching this game thinking &quot;there&#39;s still time for United to win this&quot;
@Joey7Barton arguing with @justinbieber fans on Twitter &gt; @Joey7Barton arguing with @DietmarHamann on Twitter
@GlennFyvie He ran into Nani&#39;s leg from behind. Should have been a free-kick to United!
@NewYorkOwls He had is eye on the ball and was trying to control it when someone ran into his foot from behind!
@assad_from_that I&#39;m up in CT filming a movie with Jennifer Aniston and Isla Fisher this Friday, you should stop by the set and say hi!
@assad_from_that I heard Greenwich but won&#39;t know for sure til Thursday night
Congratulations Minnesota for producing the first and last brilliant Harlem Shake videohttp://youtu.be/cVW-ZeMeh5E&nbsp;
I&#39;m excited as to how many more &quot;Akers being released &amp; misses things&quot; jokes I can read on twitter tonight
Mind Blown. Feel too old.

Teixeria&#39;s injury isn&#39;t too bad, when he&#39;s off DL in week 10 he&#39;ll have same batting stats as usual at that point of the season. #Yankees
Thanks a lot Dennis Rodman.

@NewYorkOwls make the front page of @First_Touch this week, quality! You may notice that Sheff Utd did not. #SWFChttp://www.scribd.com/doc/70000512/First-Touch-New-York-City&nbsp;…
Squeaky bum time for Wednesday fans!
@danmin1185 Auto correct has a mind of its own!
@arlowhite As a long suffering Wednesday fan in New York that was huge for us! You&#39;ll be alright by playoff time.
@danmin1185 Forrest Gump? Not a chance, busy with the guy from Bachelor Party instead
@assad_from_that shoot got cancelled due to a flurry of snow flakes. Worked on Smash instead. Kat McPhee was hot. Ran into Tom Hanks too
@assad_from_that Monday, I can&#39;t do it. I was in Stamford today and will be there tomorrow tio
@assad_from_that I&#39;m coaching at Chelsea Piers CT til 2. May stay later if we&#39;re celebrating victory!
@assad_from_that Will do...
It&#39;s a good job Chivas had a full bench so they could double their attendance figures...
Why is ESPN showing a college soccer game right now? And why are the two teams wearing MLS uniforms?
@danmin1185 Tom Hanks is the star of Bachelor Party, how&#39;ve you not seen it?!?!? I saw him on the street, he was leaving his Broadway show
@assad_from_that I was far too hungover to stick around
I expect &quot;That&#39;s so Metro&quot; to be trending any minute... #RBNY
I can&#39;t imagine many Roy Miller jerseys being sold at the #RBNY club shop tomorrow...
“@CollegeSpun: Just checked Brandon Knight&#39;s Wikipedia page - looks like someone had a little fun pic.twitter.com/bqdyb1Yj1z”
I&#39;m sure Roy Miller and Brandon Knight are both delighted to be trending worldwide right now!
I like to picture some kid in Asia online going &quot;who&#39;s this Roy Miller who&#39;s trending worldwide right now? {pause} Oh dear&quot;
@BigJohnTerry Based on what. The whole of the USA is sick to f-ing death of Tim Tebow. And Neymar?
Did everyone else enjoy their 6 emails from the Red Bulls today promoting their home opener? Kinda fortunate as I didn&#39;t notice the first 5
Tim Tebow is a taller faster Wes Welker if played in the slot. Give the Jets a call Bill! I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m joking or not... #Patriots
