Remind me to never ever rent a movie from iTunes ever again ever. Worst user experience of all time. Never again. In future, Amazon only.
@Nancy_Kelley Purchased rental on iTunes, wouldn&#39;t transfer to Apple TV; had to reset, switch to manual, and it&#39;s taking forever to sync...
@Nancy_Kelley ...when I did same w/ @AmazonVideo , purchase was reflected on all devices immediately, no hassle. iTunes loses a customer.
@Nancy_Kelley Fair enough. Diff&#39;rent strokes for diff&#39;rent folks. :)
For those just joining this complaint party: I give any new tech the benefit of a doubt until it annoys me too much. Then I salt the earth.
@wakjagner Yes, @AmazonVideo is great; has worked well on every device I&#39;ve ever owned, IIRC. And if you&#39;re Prime, lots of good free TV.
Come to think of it, that&#39;s my policy with people too: benefit of a doubt until you get on my nerves, then YOU ARE DEAD TO ME. #hugs

Every time I hear the ARROW voiceover, I wish for a show where Dig tells Ollie, &quot;Yeah, you &#39;somethin&#39; else&#39; all right, white boy.&quot; #fanfic
Tough to be a minority in a minority. I&#39;m not into Doctor Who, I don&#39;t dig Night Vale. No, I don&#39;t need convincing. I&#39;m just different, OK?
@snarke Say it loud! Say it proud! I DON&#39;T CARE ABOUT NIGHT VALE! :) #DesertBluffs4Lyfe #troll
@TheDoubleclicks You are wise beyond your years. But we knew that.
@TheDoubleclicks @snarke &quot;I liked this show better the first time around when it was called THE OUTER LIMITS&quot; ;)
@lessachu And that&#39;s okay! We don&#39;t all have to like the same things. BTW, YOU ARE NOW DEAD TO ME. ;)
Marvel may rule the multiplex, but DC owns the airwaves. 74% through ARROW season 1 on Netflix and still Diggin&#39; it so far. PUN INTENDED.
And look... I want to like #AgentsofSHIELD as much as the rest of y&#39;all, but they gotta meet us halfway on this. I&#39;m just not feelin&#39; it.
Regardless, @clarkgregg is still my homeboy. I&#39;ve been #TeamCoulson ever since he fronted QUO VADIMUS on Sports Night.
Happy Birthday @tereshkova2001 and many happy returns of the day!
Despite plot holes, I will always have a soft spot for STARGATE CONTINUUM b/c they shot on location in Arctic Circle &amp; aboard nuclear sub.
@ghalidrim You chose...poorly.
This week, I have 3 writing projects and 3 upcoming puzzle events demanding my attention. When did I ever find the time for a day job?
@snarke @ninjahq @rmalena @clarkgregg @ftcup (in Slavic accent) I have DVDs. You want DVDs? We talk. Make good deal. No vigorish.
Honestly, I just love finding any excuse to say the word &quot;vigorish.&quot;
@BrianEnigma ARROW got much more interesting after Ollie accumulated a Scooby gang. Especially Felicity Smoak. Smart chicks are hot.

@thefoodgeek &quot;Maker? I didn&#39;t even KNOW &#39;er!&quot; #rimshot #crickets #iapologizefornothing
Tonight&#39;s double feature: OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN and WHITE HOUSE DOWN. Which one gets your vote?
Ashley Judd as First Lady? Yes, please. #olympushasfallen
I wonder how many &quot;package&quot; jokes actual Secret Service agents make when no one&#39;s listening in on comms. #olympushasfallen
Yes. OF COURSE Gerard Butler is shirtless in this movie. #olympushasfallen
You&#39;re here too, Angela Bassett? Cool. Hope you get to kick some ass later. #olympushasfallen
Also, WHY did they not just make a whole movie about Melissa Leo&#39;s SECDEF character. Give me crazy backstory! #olympushasfallen
Y&#39;know, in real life I&#39;m sure a cruise missile would have taken care of this problem long before it reached DC. #olympushasfallen
No, Mr. President, &quot;find your son&quot; is not really one of the Secretary of Defense&#39;s actual job functions. #olympushasfallen
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal! #olympushasfallen
Seriously? Worst. President. Ever. #olympushasfallen
And also, you never thought to build a backdoor kill code into your super-secret nuclear failsafe system? Weaksauce. #olympushasfallen
Dylan McDermott==Bill. Bill Clay. #olympushasfallen
Helicopters now. Did they lift EVERY action beat in this movie from Die Hard? #olympushasfallen
&quot;Well, we&#39;re going to need some more FBI guys, I guess.&quot; #olympushasfallen
The Judean People&#39;s Front? The People&#39;s Front of Judea? #olympushasfallen
I apologize for my earlier tweet. Only MOST of this movie was lifted from Die Hard. The rest came from Terminator 2. #olympushasfallen
And now the climactic &quot;follow tech support instructions by phone&quot; scene! #olympushasfallen
Although, to be fair, props for using an actual, fairly secure password there. #olympushasfallen
Next up: #whitehousedown . PG-13, but includes &quot;a brief sexual image?&quot; Oh, behave.
Guys, I will be VERY disappointed if THAT was the &quot;brief sexual image.&quot; Thermal imaging? And missionary position? Come on. #whitehousedown
James Woods with a gun? Never a good idea. #whitehousedown
@splunge2000 HEYOOO
If your point man can&#39;t remember a locker combination w/o writing it on his arm, your infiltration plan may need work. #whitehousedown
Okay, so apparently this one is the young, hip, funny &quot;Die Hard in a White House&quot; movie. Or trying to be. #whitehousedown
I really just want Jake Weber to get exasperated and say &quot;Allison!&quot; to someone. #whitehousedown
So... Would that be a &quot;hard Castle,&quot; then? #whitehousedown
Oh yeah, Channing Tatum, you work those laugh lines, baby. #whitehousedown
&quot;Yes, we do need to get out of this elevator. And don&#39;t call me Shaft.&quot; #whitehousedown
Why do German action movie directors care so much about the 25th Amendment? Discuss. #whitehousedown
Not without my daughter!!! #whitehousedown
Ah, yes, the old share-your-feelings-while-bandaging-a-broken-glass-wound scene. So cliche. #whitehousedown
OK, that traffic camera bit was pretty good. #whitehousedown
Jesus, how many presidents are you people going to swear in today? #whitehousedown
&quot;How lovely to meet you... MISS CALE.&quot; #whitehousedown
Hashtag literal ticking clock  #whitehousedown
&quot;Tour&#39;s over.&quot; AWESOMESAUCE  #whitehousedown
For the record, #olympushasfallen : when an 11-year-old girl is smarter &amp; braver than POTUS in your movie, #whitehousedown wins.

So revision 6 of the Sole-Chen holiday newsletter was the final. (Yes, we edit alot.) Printing now, mailing out with cards #SOON
When it comes to writing holiday greeting cards, @DeeAnnSole and I are an unstoppable whirlwind of comedy. Comedy, I tells ya!
.@Coffee_Villa @DeeAnnSole There was dueling strikethrough humor. Also &quot;suburban excitement.&quot; And I may have drawn a grumpycat cartoon.
If you must watch A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, I highly recommend selecting the &quot;descriptive audio&quot; soundtrack on the DVD.
Yeah, no, &quot;Google Drive&quot; is still the worst product name ever. #genericbrandinternet

@jmacfee Pretty sneaky, sis.
Three hours? But I thought hobbits were (wait for it...) _short_! AHAHAHAHAHA #unfollow

.@brittamarie (You might also see me on #Grimm tonight. But probably not.)
Tonight&#39;s holiday movie night double feature was Muppet Xmas Carol and Scrooged. With pizza, beer, and a dog wearing a scarf. Portland!
@mariafi Or you could listen to a recording of Patrick Stewart&#39;s one-man-show performance. If you think you can handle that much awesome.
Not to spoil #TheRoomTwo for anybody, but it is quite clearly the wrath of... someone. http://instagram.com/p/h5QECtmpp9/&nbsp;

You guys, @lynnemthomas is live-tweeting Star Trek: The Motion Picture and it is totally awesome. #FYI #trekmas
Just watched Fast Times at Ridgemont High for the first time ever. So that happened.
@srj68 It was totally &#39;80s! And now I guess I know what people are talking about w/r/t Phoebe Cates in a red bikini.
Listening to Frozen soundtrack outtakes. Enjoying the Lopezes&#39; commentary &amp; SO GLAD that prophecy crap did not end up in the final film.
@homodachi The song was adorable, but I hate storylines that hinge on arbitrary prophecies. Always better to write to character.
@kronda Don&#39;t forget Bradley Cooper played #Face in the ill-fated 2010 A-Team remake. Not exactly a superhero, but y&#39;know. ;)
