@rickmerriam  btw, would you mind if I ask you for an iTunes review? If you&#39;ve already left one, no worries
@rickmerriam  yeah I think the nature of the show and my interests really are around creativity blended with business.
@rickmerriam  don&#39;t know if you saw the Instigator Exp page, but it&#39;s worth checking just because the designed turned out so cool.

Universal Skills that Impact Your Business with @sebastmarsh http://ow.ly/2BUx12&nbsp; #productivity
good morning twitterverse. What&#39;s up in your world this morning?
@johnrampton  quite well. I guess moving on from SEJ was kind of meant to be considering what&#39;s come after :)
@CrazyDadLife I&#39;m back to work this morning too, but no office. Just getting geared up for 2014 :).
@CrazyDadLife  that will be what this week&#39;s BlogcastFM newsletter will be about :)

@tferriss as an avid surfer, I&#39;d say go with Laird if you can get him. He&#39;s surfed damn near everything.
@snsmth @tferriss  Yeah, Sean is right. The water is way warmer and waves are WAY better in CR.
@snsmth @tferriss  yeah, I wouldn&#39;t attempt Hermosa until you&#39;ve got some skills because that wave will hand your ass to you :)
@snsmth @tferriss  Yeah, I&#39;m  actually really interested to see this because so many variables are out your control when you surf :)
@snsmth and don&#39;t forget the locals are not particularly forgiving at any advanced break. HEHE
@CatalystCrystal @patflynn  thank you. So glad you liked it.
@spencershaw @GaryErd @jaltucher  thanks for the shootout

Happy Friday twitterverse. who&#39;s the most interesting new person you discovered this week? #ff
@johnnyacabral  good question. Yes, possibly less sleep. But more efficiency.  Set aside a working block each day.
@johnnyacabral  could be an hour, could be 30 mins. As long as you&#39;re consistent you&#39;ll make progress.
@johnnyacabral  and read less blogs, write more.  Do what Cal Newport calls the deep work
@johnnyacabral  that&#39;s not a bad thing. most actual creation happens in solitude frm what I&#39;ve found

@jasonvo so glad you liked the article. I&#39;m actually working on another book called the 1000 word habit :).
@jasonvo  also a simple hack, put a post it note on your computer that says &quot;what&#39;s the most important thing you could be doing rt now?&quot;
@socialforsmallb sweet :). Once you get to a certain point, your days will feel incomplete without it. That&#39;s a great feeling
@jasonvo  will be a few months. Busy with instigator experience. BTW did you get the Art of BEing Unmistakable?
@jasonvo  that 1000 word habit landed my self published book on  the WSJ bestseller list. Crazy huh

@galadarling yeah I just find it offensive.  nobody would pitch the national media that way.
@BrigitteLyons  well you know from our chats, my filters are ruthless ;)
@BrigitteLyons  I&#39;ve found myself saying no a lot more than yes lately
@BrigitteLyons  the truth is, it&#39;s never personal. It&#39;s about a responsibility to our listeners.
@BrigitteLyons  hehe. No I didnt&#39; say that. You rocked it :)
I can&#39;t seem to update my personal FB status…It just does nothing. anybody know what might be causing that

@ericbrocksome  sweet/ I hope you like it
@amilum  well I think that article has lots of truth.  To some degree you are what you offer, but, there&#39;s a part that&#39;s not too
@amilum  yeah that&#39;s fair. I think that there&#39;s more than what you offer.
@amilum   but I think why becomes clearer when you get good at something or develop a skill
@ericbrocksome  that&#39;s music to my ears. Mind if I ask you to review on amazon?
@amilum  well I don&#39;t know. If I had sat around trying to figure out why, I would never done anything. I think it evolves over time
@amilum  and if you believe in something but are not any good at it, it doesn&#39;t really matter in my opinion
@ericbrocksome  thanks. Really appreciate it. I&#39;m so glad to hear you liked it.
