@tinyFey just send me an email with your resume and any other pertinent information -- thanks!
@lintool @abdur does twitter even have product that does event detection? trending topics != events.
i used to think the limit (as t -&gt; infinity) of unread emails in my inbox was convergent, but recent evidence refutes that hypothesis.
dear @KAYAK, please stop with the horrible &quot;personalized&quot; contextual ads about beijing travel deals. i&#39;ve already gone there and returned.
@jerepick I suppose businessmen exhibit travel destination burstiness. However, my travel destination distribution is much more uniform :)
@jerepick (with respect to international travel, that is... domestic is a completely different story)

today&#39;s deadlines: #wsdm2012 papers and TREC microblog track runs.
just submitted our @trecmicroblog runs. i look forward to seeing what approaches other groups took. #trec2011
WSDM submissions flat year-over-year -- 290 for #wsdm2010, 381 for #wsdm2011, and 367 for #wsdm2012
@iadh Last year may have also attracted more papers from Asia. I wonder if SIGIR will see a similar trend from this year to next.
@jteevan The number I quoted was from the &quot;Reviewer Instructions&quot; email sent by the 2011 PC chairs. Prob a few papers dropped during review.
@web_miner i&#39;d personally like a set of knobs that let me trade off personal relevance, network relevance, and recency (cc @twittersearch)

@nimatwtr every time i feel down, i just read your tweet stream, and it makes me feel a lot better.
i noticed a variable number of spam bots follow me each time i tweet. i wonder if it&#39;s random or has to do w/ specific keywords. let&#39;s test.
seo, sem, search engines, marketing, analytics, optimization, ads, advertising, ranking, web site, services, google, yahoo, bing, first page
@ian_soboroff you&#39;re right. that strangely netted me 3 legit followers and just 2 spam bots. weird. maybe not the right set of topic words.
@ian_soboroff maybe something like &quot;where can i buy twitter and facebook followers and grow my network ?&quot; will be more effective.
@diazf_y feel much shaking there?
@diazf_y that&#39;s clearly the only plausible explanation for this quake and the one in CO last night.
@BenCarterette was that your warm welcome home from Russia?
@stuartrobinson that&#39;s a great title for an IR book (or a SIGIR tutorial...)
dumb question: what&#39;s the correct usage of &quot;toward&quot; vs &quot;towards&quot;? the copy edits for a manuscript i&#39;m preparing suggest i have no idea.
@jerepick they changed all of my &quot;towards&quot; to &quot;toward&quot;. maybe they just wanted to save ink to lower costs.
@stuartrobinson Interesting! Perhaps it&#39;s a regional (NW PA) thing. I was raised to say other bizarre things like &quot;what do you taste for?&quot;
@delsweil &quot;toward&quot; just sounds funny to me. i guess i&#39;m more british than i knew :)
@stuartrobinson Yeah. That&#39;s another one I never realized was weird until I told someone &quot;my car needs washed&quot;.
@ian_soboroff unlike you, i can&#39;t even construct an s-less tweet. i look forward to your s-less SIGIR paper next year.
another well-executed LA machine learning meetup today. kudos to @petricek and @zaxtax
now that the initial google+ buzz has died down, my stream is more like a slow drip only worth checking once or twice a week, at most.
@XplusOne good question! i was trying to determine what types of keywords are most targeted by spambots.
.@davidandrzej interesting work! will definitely read the paper. (fwiw, i would strongly recommend to never use the indri &quot;#not&quot; operator)
@arjenpdevries i was responsible for L8 and L15. unfortunately, i haven&#39;t seen anyone actually use these in any papers.
@arjenpdevries btw, if you have a particular data need, you can always ping someone in y! and they can try to get it released for you.
elevators should require a special &quot;i&#39;m unable to climb stairs&quot; access card for all rides between floors n and n+1 (or n-1).
4.2 earthquake in the san fernando valley. very light shaking here in marina del rey.
@HCIR_GeneG i&#39;m guessing a small %. most are likely random junk, strange misspellings, and bizarre long queries.
i&#39;m co-chairing the #ictir2011 best paper award committee. we have a strong, diverse pool of candidates to choose from.
not too surprised by the bartz news. she was one of the factors that caused me to leave yahoo!
@ian_soboroff you mean, other than government red tape?
@ian_soboroff 10 years at NIST?
@ian_soboroff that&#39;s a nice milestone, btw. only 40 more years until the coveted CD-534.
@stuartrobinson awesome. thanks for the pointer!
attending the southern california machine learning workshop at UC irvine
my socal machine learning workshop slides: http://bit.ly/q5QAN4&nbsp; . asks what&#39;s more important for learning to rank - features or models?
it&#39;s only 10am and i already don&#39;t want to eat any more mooncake this year.
@lintool that was exactly my argument. no need for incremental modeling improvements when you have lots of data and strong features.
@jerepick yes, excellent point! if the language is expressive enough then the distinction begins to blur such that query = features + model
@lintool that&#39;s exactly what i thought... at least it&#39;s a step in the right direction.
@ian_soboroff @trecmicroblog did i miss something or has there been some sort of delay?
it&#39;s a longshot, but... does anyone in los angeles know if book royalties necessitate a business tax registration certificate? #la #dtla
mostly happy with our @trecmicroblog results. we kept it simple and combined a number of proven techniques w/ domain-specific adaptations.
@milesEfron i look forward to reading your notebook paper! i wish we had found the time to do something a bit more risky ourselves.
my first patent was recently granted (US 8,005,845). basic idea: &quot;intent-adaptive machine learned query-biased summarization&quot;
twitter started randomly(?) dropping posts made by my followers from my timeline. i&#39;ve missed a few &quot;important&quot; messages as a result.
@web_miner yes, but when combined they gives rise to a very specific (yet broadly defined) &quot;invention&quot; (that yahoo now has little use for.)
#twitter segmentation #fail... trending topic &quot;Ask Don&quot; as in... &quot;don&#39;t ASK, DON&#39;t tell&quot;.
http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-board-not-looking-for-ceo-2011-9&nbsp;… ... Yahoo! Research =&gt; News Corp Research? Doesn&#39;t have quite the same ring to it.
i&#39;m not a fan of facebook&#39;s redesign, but i do like their new open graph features. nice, simple way to add basic semantics to web content
@arjenpdevries you can add the tags to any web page. e.g., you can appify your publications page with &quot;+Read It&quot; buttons if you so choose
@arjenpdevries @diazf_y i wouldnt actually use this myself, but will gladly scrape other&#39;s &quot;open graph&quot; content as a rich source of evidence
another Twitter trending topic gem (for Los Angeles): &quot;Tomorrow is Friday&quot; (trending on Friday, go figure)
do any search toolkits support per-tag weighting? i want to have &lt;tag wt=&quot;3&quot;&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt; in the text and use 3 during ranking. @TerrierTeam ?
@pbrane thanks! low-level custom code isn&#39;t a problem. better than the complexities of implementing new index data structures myself.
@craig_macdonald thanks, craig. indri supports the same. the problem with that solution is variable # of tags per doc (think anchor text)
@craig_macdonald if terrier implemented that, then you might make a convert out of me, afterall ;)
@craig_macdonald unfortunately, no. weights will be arbitrary real-values in no way connected to the TF (or IDF) of the span&#39;s text.
@arjenpdevries nope, the weights are static and computed prior to indexing.
do any cities have a &quot;smart grid&quot; of traffic signals? LA could seriously use some more sensors + intelligence to improve system-wide flow.
@CathyE nice -- thanks for the pointer!
@HCIR_GeneG my pet peeve: when dozens of cars end up waiting at a red light for &gt; 3 minutes, while zero cars pass through the green light
@jelsas depends on how you define &quot;open&quot;. most publishers (ACM, Elsevier) allow posting to personal web sites. WWW used to put PDFs on web
there&#39;s a fine line between being too busy and being utterly incompetent
@julian_urbano successful procrastination is an art :)
@diazf_y @twittersearch furthermore, [can] should not match [can&#39;t].
my interest in a given seminar is inversely proportional to the number of reminder emails i receive about it
@julian_urbano i wonder if they would accept a scanned hand-written PDF.
when using NER annotator w/ latest @stanfordnlp, set ner.useSUTime prop to false to avoid endless exceptions/warnings for docs w/o date tags
@stanfordnlp It is useful for docs w/ timestamps. BTW, not all msgs are just &quot;logging&quot;. I got a NullPointerException @ SUTime.java:1707.

CA homeowners -- did you get any specific earthquake-related inspections done (beyond the minimal ones required by state law) when buying?
@stuartrobinson yeah, probably will end up getting a geologist. have some concerns about liquefaction potential and/or landslides.
i&#39;d be more tempted to try out iamResearcher if they didn&#39;t have such a grammatically incorrect name.
does #pandora serve anyone else geo-targeted ads for completely random midwestern cities that nobody&#39;s ever heard of? or is it just me?
@diazf_y i did spend four years in terre haute, indiana. i&#39;m thankfully avoided picking up a taste for ICP (or PCP, for that matter.)
@i_am_researcher i was of course only joking. i hope to give it a try when i have a few free minutes.
not to be rude, but the #lucene &quot;DefaultSimilarity&quot; scoring function is an abomination. are users satisfied with its ranking quality?

metareviews should summarize the strengths/weaknesses raised by the reviewers. writing &quot;reject based on reviews&quot; is just phoning it in.
@bemikelive @doridayan smh
@SethGrimes Sentence boundary detection for Web docs = hard. Adding sentence boundary info to search index = expensive. Demand = little.
a plagiarized version of our SIGIR &#39;10 &quot;Learning to Efficiently Rank&quot; paper found its way into a Materials Science journal, of all places...
@vitroc another researcher told us about it. i have no idea how they discovered it.

USC/ISI now has an (alleged) quantum computer (http://dailytrojan.com/2011/10/30/usc-receives-first-quantum-computer/&nbsp;…) - time to put quantum IR theories to the test?
@julian_urbano didn&#39;t report yet, but will. fake authors? never thought of that. what&#39;s their agenda? citation factories?
@kohlschuetter thanks for the support! i&#39;m guessing nothing will ever come of it, but it&#39;s certainly worth trying to get resolved.
@stuartrobinson @SebastianThrun key metrics: intelligence vs. propensity to cheat in both populations. too many unknowns to say for sure.
today google rolled out better support for implicitly year qualified queries, wh/ we studied in a YRL &#39;09 tech report: http://www.isi.edu/~metzler/papers/2009-002_Metzler.pdf&nbsp;…

i finally looked up how to say &quot;wrong number&quot; in spanish -- &quot;número equivocado&quot;. that will come in handy.
coding rawcomparators for complex user-defined writable objects in hadoop is well worth the effort (and kind of fun).
@kunegis thanks!
@kohlschuetter @diazf_y regarding the &quot;+&quot; operator issue. google rolled out &quot;verbatim search&quot; today (http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/11/search-using-your-terms-verbatim.html&nbsp;…)
@diazf_y i&#39;d be interested in your findings, as well. don&#39;t know of too many IR-specific query languages, really, or user-facing studies.
@diazf_y google should adopt an indri-style query language. #verbatim(inquery stopword list)
@cherhan @julian_urbano @iadh unfortunately not at TREC. like this idea. perhaps tie w/ news feed (eg &quot;predicting tomorrow&#39;s headlines&quot;)
@arjenpdevries no, you&#39;re absolutely correct. the inquery folks deserve all the credit!
only at USC: &quot;... suspect approached him and stated he had a weapon (none seen) demanding complainant&#39;s lunch&quot;. strong armed lunch robbery.
who honestly thought it would be a good idea to have two NLP paper deadlines following peak vacation time? (NAACL-HLT: Jan 6, ACL: Jan 15).

the ICTIR 2013 call for bids is heavily Euro-centric. perhaps the &quot;I&quot; should be replaced with an &quot;E&quot;.
@arjenpdevries none of the above :) although not explicitly stated, it appears as though non-European bids won&#39;t be considered.
@arjenpdevries specifically &quot;The location should be easily accessible for people attending from across Europe and elsewhere.&quot;

@cegme i couldn&#39;t agree more. over half of the things they claim are &quot;breaking news&quot; are anything but.
despite the fact i only tweet about geek-laden topics, twitter insists on suggesting i follow chris brown, snoop dogg, and trey songz
@ian_soboroff that strategy seems to have moved me from the space of NBA players to R&amp;B singers. it&#39;ll be interesting to see what&#39;s next.
@lintool is this subtle foreshadowing?
&quot;who to follow&quot; #fail continues. after nba players and r&amp;b singers, i now get actors (sheen, hill) and something called &quot;tap pet hotel&quot;
@DataJunkie i&#39;m not sure if this is bad matching, bad CF, bad personalization, incognito &quot;promoted&quot; suggestions, or something else entirely.
@HCIR_GeneG i hadn&#39;t thought of that. uh oh.

just about any semi-interesting word i include in my tweet attracts spammers. asbestos.
@stuartrobinson more likely than not, some sort of spambot.

@ChrisDiehl if you want to see George&#39;s face turn red, and his blood begin to boil, talk to him about Pig bugs/errors/documentation
@HCIR_GeneG i went through my tweet history a few days ago hoping to answer you, but couldn&#39;t seem to find anything. i&#39;ll look again now.

@ChrisDiehl it sounds like you are well on your way (if not already there) to having Pig war stories of your own :)
negative okapi idfs + max_score query optimization = fail
wow, the LA office of finance tax and permit division is so horribly incompetent. makes me want to flee LA even more.
i tend to overuse the word &quot;very&quot;. is there a psycholinguistic theory/explanation/name for this very annoying habit?
@lintool very interesting! then perhaps it&#39;s something i subconsciously picked up from my wife and/or chinese colleagues
@DataJunkie thanks for the free advertising!
@sgouws very cool! it even correctly detected my horribly scripted \xi
udacity using search engines as CS101 is a brilliant marketing ploy. to actually learn about search, read an information retrieval book.

@HCIR_GeneG i&#39;ll have limited availability during the days. if you, @ChrisDiehl, + others want to get together some evening that&#39;d be great
1) find cool data set 2) compute elementary statistics 3) post tag cloud or map viz to your blog 4) declare yourself a &quot;data scientist&quot;
@elunca @HCIR_GeneG @ChrisDiehl any day after 6pm that week works for me. mt view (or anywhere on light rail would be most convenient)
@zaxtax i&#39;ll be in the bay area for the next couple of weeks, too. let me know if you find some folks who want to get together
Tomorrow&#39;s my first day back at Yahoo. I sure picked an interesting time to rejoin.

@HCIR_GeneG @elunca sounds good. what day next week would work best for you guys? any day except friday is ok with me
@HCIR_GeneG @elunca ok, tuesday it is, then! i&#39;m impartial. do either of you have any preferences?
@JeffD thanks for the free advertisement, Jeff!
@stanfordnlp i strategically managed to open source mavuno before i left, so i plan to continue maintaining/developing it.
@HCIR_GeneG pretty easy. the quality would depend on the NLP stack&#39;s &quot;compatibility&quot; with ur data. do u have newswire? web? something else?

our (long) paper titled &quot;Structured Event Retrieval over Microblog Archives&quot; was accepted at NAACL-HLT
@HCIR_GeneG nope. much more interesting than that :) we retrieve structured representations of events in response to ad hoc search queries
@HCIR_GeneG technically, it can be as few as 1, but realistically you want enough to generate a good summary of the event
@stuartrobinson of course. but since this is an academic paper you have to make it sound overly fancy / general :)
@francesco1986_ yep. event query =&gt; burst detection =&gt; temporal query expansion =&gt; tweet retrieval =&gt; generate &quot;structured&quot; results

@diazf_y i ultimately decided that nothing of great significance would arise any time soon, so i punted on it.
@JeffD small magnitude gains can also be substantive. even tiny (e.g., tenths of a %) gains in DCG in commercial search =&gt; lots of $$.

@ian_soboroff perks: increased awareness of exciting government processes you probably never knew about (e.g., continuing resolutions).

@sgouws how long will you be in LA?
@sgouws yeah, i&#39;ll be around the whole time. you should stop by for lunch w/ me and @congxing.

@jcmayfield the tweeter&#39;s dilemma: to actually make sense or to make sure your tweet is discoverable? i obviously chose the latter.
@fdiaz_msr yes, of course. there&#39;s writing papers, and then there&#39;s making magic.

over the past year, the word that is most likely to co-trend with &quot;layoffs&quot; on Twitter is &quot;yahoo&quot; (i&#39;m not joking).
I apparently have one of the top 1% most viewed @LinkedIn profiles for 2012. However, 1% of 200M = really not that impressive.
@hintikka That&#39;s probably it. And the fact that probably 75% of those 200M people have probably only logged in once and have empty profiles.
@tetsuyasakai i find it amazing some japanese tweets characterize a 5.7 magnitude as a &quot;small tremor&quot;. your preparedness is most impressive.

MS has been heavily publishing about their use of toolbar data for ranking for the past 5 years. so how is this surprising?

@nimatwtr every time i feel down, i just read your tweet stream, and it makes me feel a lot better.
i noticed a variable number of spam bots follow me each time i tweet. i wonder if it&#39;s random or has to do w/ specific keywords. let&#39;s test.
seo, sem, search engines, marketing, analytics, optimization, ads, advertising, ranking, web site, services, google, yahoo, bing, first page
@ian_soboroff you&#39;re right. that strangely netted me 3 legit followers and just 2 spam bots. weird. maybe not the right set of topic words.
@ian_soboroff maybe something like &quot;where can i buy twitter and facebook followers and grow my network ?&quot; will be more effective.
@diazf_y feel much shaking there?
@diazf_y that&#39;s clearly the only plausible explanation for this quake and the one in CO last night.
@BenCarterette was that your warm welcome home from Russia?
@stuartrobinson that&#39;s a great title for an IR book (or a SIGIR tutorial...)
dumb question: what&#39;s the correct usage of &quot;toward&quot; vs &quot;towards&quot;? the copy edits for a manuscript i&#39;m preparing suggest i have no idea.
@jerepick they changed all of my &quot;towards&quot; to &quot;toward&quot;. maybe they just wanted to save ink to lower costs.
@stuartrobinson Interesting! Perhaps it&#39;s a regional (NW PA) thing. I was raised to say other bizarre things like &quot;what do you taste for?&quot;
@delsweil &quot;toward&quot; just sounds funny to me. i guess i&#39;m more british than i knew :)
@stuartrobinson Yeah. That&#39;s another one I never realized was weird until I told someone &quot;my car needs washed&quot;.
@ian_soboroff unlike you, i can&#39;t even construct an s-less tweet. i look forward to your s-less SIGIR paper next year.
another well-executed LA machine learning meetup today. kudos to @petricek and @zaxtax
now that the initial google+ buzz has died down, my stream is more like a slow drip only worth checking once or twice a week, at most.
@XplusOne good question! i was trying to determine what types of keywords are most targeted by spambots.
.@davidandrzej interesting work! will definitely read the paper. (fwiw, i would strongly recommend to never use the indri &quot;#not&quot; operator)
@arjenpdevries i was responsible for L8 and L15. unfortunately, i haven&#39;t seen anyone actually use these in any papers.
@arjenpdevries btw, if you have a particular data need, you can always ping someone in y! and they can try to get it released for you.
elevators should require a special &quot;i&#39;m unable to climb stairs&quot; access card for all rides between floors n and n+1 (or n-1).
4.2 earthquake in the san fernando valley. very light shaking here in marina del rey.
@HCIR_GeneG i&#39;m guessing a small %. most are likely random junk, strange misspellings, and bizarre long queries.
i&#39;m co-chairing the #ictir2011 best paper award committee. we have a strong, diverse pool of candidates to choose from.
not too surprised by the bartz news. she was one of the factors that caused me to leave yahoo!
@ian_soboroff you mean, other than government red tape?
@ian_soboroff 10 years at NIST?
@ian_soboroff that&#39;s a nice milestone, btw. only 40 more years until the coveted CD-534.
@stuartrobinson awesome. thanks for the pointer!
attending the southern california machine learning workshop at UC irvine
my socal machine learning workshop slides: http://bit.ly/q5QAN4&nbsp; . asks what&#39;s more important for learning to rank - features or models?
it&#39;s only 10am and i already don&#39;t want to eat any more mooncake this year.
@lintool that was exactly my argument. no need for incremental modeling improvements when you have lots of data and strong features.
@jerepick yes, excellent point! if the language is expressive enough then the distinction begins to blur such that query = features + model
@lintool that&#39;s exactly what i thought... at least it&#39;s a step in the right direction.
@ian_soboroff @trecmicroblog did i miss something or has there been some sort of delay?
it&#39;s a longshot, but... does anyone in los angeles know if book royalties necessitate a business tax registration certificate? #la #dtla
mostly happy with our @trecmicroblog results. we kept it simple and combined a number of proven techniques w/ domain-specific adaptations.
@milesEfron i look forward to reading your notebook paper! i wish we had found the time to do something a bit more risky ourselves.
my first patent was recently granted (US 8,005,845). basic idea: &quot;intent-adaptive machine learned query-biased summarization&quot;
twitter started randomly(?) dropping posts made by my followers from my timeline. i&#39;ve missed a few &quot;important&quot; messages as a result.
@web_miner yes, but when combined they gives rise to a very specific (yet broadly defined) &quot;invention&quot; (that yahoo now has little use for.)
#twitter segmentation #fail... trending topic &quot;Ask Don&quot; as in... &quot;don&#39;t ASK, DON&#39;t tell&quot;.
http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-board-not-looking-for-ceo-2011-9&nbsp;… ... Yahoo! Research =&gt; News Corp Research? Doesn&#39;t have quite the same ring to it.
i&#39;m not a fan of facebook&#39;s redesign, but i do like their new open graph features. nice, simple way to add basic semantics to web content
@arjenpdevries you can add the tags to any web page. e.g., you can appify your publications page with &quot;+Read It&quot; buttons if you so choose
@arjenpdevries @diazf_y i wouldnt actually use this myself, but will gladly scrape other&#39;s &quot;open graph&quot; content as a rich source of evidence
another Twitter trending topic gem (for Los Angeles): &quot;Tomorrow is Friday&quot; (trending on Friday, go figure)
do any search toolkits support per-tag weighting? i want to have &lt;tag wt=&quot;3&quot;&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt; in the text and use 3 during ranking. @TerrierTeam ?
@pbrane thanks! low-level custom code isn&#39;t a problem. better than the complexities of implementing new index data structures myself.
@craig_macdonald thanks, craig. indri supports the same. the problem with that solution is variable # of tags per doc (think anchor text)
@craig_macdonald if terrier implemented that, then you might make a convert out of me, afterall ;)
@craig_macdonald unfortunately, no. weights will be arbitrary real-values in no way connected to the TF (or IDF) of the span&#39;s text.
@arjenpdevries nope, the weights are static and computed prior to indexing.
do any cities have a &quot;smart grid&quot; of traffic signals? LA could seriously use some more sensors + intelligence to improve system-wide flow.
@CathyE nice -- thanks for the pointer!
@HCIR_GeneG my pet peeve: when dozens of cars end up waiting at a red light for &gt; 3 minutes, while zero cars pass through the green light
@jelsas depends on how you define &quot;open&quot;. most publishers (ACM, Elsevier) allow posting to personal web sites. WWW used to put PDFs on web
there&#39;s a fine line between being too busy and being utterly incompetent
@julian_urbano successful procrastination is an art :)
@diazf_y @twittersearch furthermore, [can] should not match [can&#39;t].
my interest in a given seminar is inversely proportional to the number of reminder emails i receive about it
@julian_urbano i wonder if they would accept a scanned hand-written PDF.
when using NER annotator w/ latest @stanfordnlp, set ner.useSUTime prop to false to avoid endless exceptions/warnings for docs w/o date tags
@stanfordnlp It is useful for docs w/ timestamps. BTW, not all msgs are just &quot;logging&quot;. I got a NullPointerException @ SUTime.java:1707.
Mavuno is now available! Open source. Scalable (Hadoop). Modular. Supports large-scale #nlproc and text mining. Get it: http://bit.ly/nQS2dn&nbsp;

@stuartrobinson yeah, probably will end up getting a geologist. have some concerns about liquefaction potential and/or landslides.

does #pandora serve anyone else geo-targeted ads for completely random midwestern cities that nobody&#39;s ever heard of? or is it just me?
@diazf_y i did spend four years in terre haute, indiana. i&#39;m thankfully avoided picking up a taste for ICP (or PCP, for that matter.)
@i_am_researcher i was of course only joking. i hope to give it a try when i have a few free minutes.
not to be rude, but the #lucene &quot;DefaultSimilarity&quot; scoring function is an abomination. are users satisfied with its ranking quality?

metareviews should summarize the strengths/weaknesses raised by the reviewers. writing &quot;reject based on reviews&quot; is just phoning it in.
@bemikelive @doridayan smh
@SethGrimes Sentence boundary detection for Web docs = hard. Adding sentence boundary info to search index = expensive. Demand = little.
a plagiarized version of our SIGIR &#39;10 &quot;Learning to Efficiently Rank&quot; paper found its way into a Materials Science journal, of all places...
@vitroc another researcher told us about it. i have no idea how they discovered it.

USC/ISI now has an (alleged) quantum computer (http://dailytrojan.com/2011/10/30/usc-receives-first-quantum-computer/&nbsp;…) - time to put quantum IR theories to the test?
@julian_urbano didn&#39;t report yet, but will. fake authors? never thought of that. what&#39;s their agenda? citation factories?
@kohlschuetter thanks for the support! i&#39;m guessing nothing will ever come of it, but it&#39;s certainly worth trying to get resolved.
@stuartrobinson @SebastianThrun key metrics: intelligence vs. propensity to cheat in both populations. too many unknowns to say for sure.
today google rolled out better support for implicitly year qualified queries, wh/ we studied in a YRL &#39;09 tech report: http://www.isi.edu/~metzler/papers/2009-002_Metzler.pdf&nbsp;…

i finally looked up how to say &quot;wrong number&quot; in spanish -- &quot;número equivocado&quot;. that will come in handy.
coding rawcomparators for complex user-defined writable objects in hadoop is well worth the effort (and kind of fun).
@kunegis thanks!
@kohlschuetter @diazf_y regarding the &quot;+&quot; operator issue. google rolled out &quot;verbatim search&quot; today (http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/11/search-using-your-terms-verbatim.html&nbsp;…)
@diazf_y i&#39;d be interested in your findings, as well. don&#39;t know of too many IR-specific query languages, really, or user-facing studies.
@diazf_y google should adopt an indri-style query language. #verbatim(inquery stopword list)
@cherhan @julian_urbano @iadh unfortunately not at TREC. like this idea. perhaps tie w/ news feed (eg &quot;predicting tomorrow&#39;s headlines&quot;)
@arjenpdevries no, you&#39;re absolutely correct. the inquery folks deserve all the credit!
only at USC: &quot;... suspect approached him and stated he had a weapon (none seen) demanding complainant&#39;s lunch&quot;. strong armed lunch robbery.
who honestly thought it would be a good idea to have two NLP paper deadlines following peak vacation time? (NAACL-HLT: Jan 6, ACL: Jan 15).

&quot;new and improved&quot; klout topics are horrible. i&#39;m apparently influential about &quot;email&quot;, &quot;notebook&quot;, and &quot;models&quot; (the half-naked kind)
the ICTIR 2013 call for bids is heavily Euro-centric. perhaps the &quot;I&quot; should be replaced with an &quot;E&quot;.
@arjenpdevries none of the above :) although not explicitly stated, it appears as though non-European bids won&#39;t be considered.
@arjenpdevries specifically &quot;The location should be easily accessible for people attending from across Europe and elsewhere.&quot;

@cegme i couldn&#39;t agree more. over half of the things they claim are &quot;breaking news&quot; are anything but.
despite the fact i only tweet about geek-laden topics, twitter insists on suggesting i follow chris brown, snoop dogg, and trey songz
@ian_soboroff that strategy seems to have moved me from the space of NBA players to R&amp;B singers. it&#39;ll be interesting to see what&#39;s next.
@lintool is this subtle foreshadowing?
&quot;who to follow&quot; #fail continues. after nba players and r&amp;b singers, i now get actors (sheen, hill) and something called &quot;tap pet hotel&quot;
@DataJunkie i&#39;m not sure if this is bad matching, bad CF, bad personalization, incognito &quot;promoted&quot; suggestions, or something else entirely.
@HCIR_GeneG i hadn&#39;t thought of that. uh oh.

just about any semi-interesting word i include in my tweet attracts spammers. asbestos.
@stuartrobinson more likely than not, some sort of spambot.
sorry @cnnbrk, you&#39;ve distracted me with far too many non-breaking news events. i&#39;m unfollowing you and removing you from my phone.
@ChrisDiehl if you want to see George&#39;s face turn red, and his blood begin to boil, talk to him about Pig bugs/errors/documentation
@HCIR_GeneG i went through my tweet history a few days ago hoping to answer you, but couldn&#39;t seem to find anything. i&#39;ll look again now.

@ChrisDiehl it sounds like you are well on your way (if not already there) to having Pig war stories of your own :)
negative okapi idfs + max_score query optimization = fail
wow, the LA office of finance tax and permit division is so horribly incompetent. makes me want to flee LA even more.
i tend to overuse the word &quot;very&quot;. is there a psycholinguistic theory/explanation/name for this very annoying habit?
@lintool very interesting! then perhaps it&#39;s something i subconsciously picked up from my wife and/or chinese colleagues
@DataJunkie thanks for the free advertising!
@sgouws very cool! it even correctly detected my horribly scripted \xi
udacity using search engines as CS101 is a brilliant marketing ploy. to actually learn about search, read an information retrieval book.
just deleted my @klout account. it&#39;s scoring was seemingly arbitrary, it&#39;s topics were horrible, and the perks were lame.

@aria42 that has yet to make its way into any of the naive characterizations of the field that i&#39;ve heard

@HCIR_GeneG i&#39;ll have limited availability during the days. if you, @ChrisDiehl, + others want to get together some evening that&#39;d be great
1) find cool data set 2) compute elementary statistics 3) post tag cloud or map viz to your blog 4) declare yourself a &quot;data scientist&quot;
@elunca @HCIR_GeneG @ChrisDiehl any day after 6pm that week works for me. mt view (or anywhere on light rail would be most convenient)
@zaxtax i&#39;ll be in the bay area for the next couple of weeks, too. let me know if you find some folks who want to get together

@HCIR_GeneG @elunca sounds good. what day next week would work best for you guys? any day except friday is ok with me
@HCIR_GeneG @elunca ok, tuesday it is, then! i&#39;m impartial. do either of you have any preferences?
@JeffD thanks for the free advertisement, Jeff!
@stanfordnlp i strategically managed to open source mavuno before i left, so i plan to continue maintaining/developing it.

our (long) paper titled &quot;Structured Event Retrieval over Microblog Archives&quot; was accepted at NAACL-HLT
@HCIR_GeneG nope. much more interesting than that :) we retrieve structured representations of events in response to ad hoc search queries
@HCIR_GeneG technically, it can be as few as 1, but realistically you want enough to generate a good summary of the event
@stuartrobinson of course. but since this is an academic paper you have to make it sound overly fancy / general :)
@francesco1986_ yep. event query =&gt; burst detection =&gt; temporal query expansion =&gt; tweet retrieval =&gt; generate &quot;structured&quot; results

@diazf_y i ultimately decided that nothing of great significance would arise any time soon, so i punted on it.
@JeffD small magnitude gains can also be substantive. even tiny (e.g., tenths of a %) gains in DCG in commercial search =&gt; lots of $$.

@brendan642 stemming/spell-correction typically done contextually (at the word and/or char level). many possible implementations.
@brendan642 feel free to email me (see web site for contact info). would be happy to explain in more detail.
@gilelbaz i saw you at the google office last week w/ tom. was going to say hi, but didn&#39;t want to interrupt. hope you enjoyed your visit.

I&#39;m surprised how many people fail to realize this happened *last year* - Dennis Ritchie Passes Away http://prsm.tc/vBnJKG&nbsp; via @prismatic
@peter_c_william Yeah, it almost certainly has to be the result of blind retweeting.
Tech Titans Buy Homes in Los Angeles http://prsm.tc/J7WEot&nbsp; via @prismatic
@bradfordcross yeah, that was a particularly bad couple of weeks. i think that ritchie&#39;s passing was largely overshadowed by jobs&#39; death.
@bradfordcross @peter_c_william reminds me of academics citing papers they&#39;ve never read, and may have never existed (http://blog.codalism.com/?p=773&nbsp;)
@fdiaz_msr @tetsuyasakai sounds interesting!

#www2011 relevance and ranking track had a solid set of papers submitted this year. track acceptance rate=19% (vs. 12% overall accept rate)
@KushalDave depends on score distributions. 0-1 normalization and z-normalization tend to work well in practice.

@bemikelive I&#39;m surprised it took them this long to do this. It&#39;s all about tracking, err, &quot;analytics&quot;.

@lintool i was having the same exact problem today.. my supposed stochastic matrix was not-even-close-to-stochastic
@bemikelive the question is as ignorant as the contestants. i&#39;d say the country&#39;s name officially starts with U, not A.
If you&#39;re in LA and interested in machine learning, this talk by Yan Liu should be good -http://www.meetup.com/LA-Machine-Learning/events/95951242/?a=ea1_grp&amp;rv=ea1&nbsp;…
Don&#39;t forget that #www2011 papers are due at *6PM* Pacific time.
#www2010 relevance and ranking track only received 45 submissions, compared to 77 last year
#naacl2013 reviews done. lots of good ideas, but so many bad evaluations. doing IR experiments? check this out: http://bit.ly/R5Glgz&nbsp;
@blekko is a step in the right direction in terms of more expressive, powerful query languages. it also has some fun IR geek tools (/rank)

For the first time in 9 years, I&#39;m not preparing a paper for #sigir2013. In other words, I had a very stress-free December and January.
@jcmayfield the tweeter&#39;s dilemma: to actually make sense or to make sure your tweet is discoverable? i obviously chose the latter.
@fdiaz_msr yes, of course. there&#39;s writing papers, and then there&#39;s making magic.
@julian_urbano @HCIR_GeneG i&#39;ve always wanted to try procrastinating, but never got around to it.
passagifiable -- the ability to split a document into passages.
note to self: do not accidentally click buttons in confmaster minutes before a paper deadline, especially when you are very tired
@hintikka sounds fascinating. i look forward to seeing the slides!
@arjenpdevries nothing actually happened, but i came close to accidentally withdrawing a paper
over the past year, the word that is most likely to co-trend with &quot;layoffs&quot; on Twitter is &quot;yahoo&quot; (i&#39;m not joking).
I apparently have one of the top 1% most viewed @LinkedIn profiles for 2012. However, 1% of 200M = really not that impressive.
@hintikka That&#39;s probably it. And the fact that probably 75% of those 200M people have probably only logged in once and have empty profiles.
@tetsuyasakai i find it amazing some japanese tweets characterize a 5.7 magnitude as a &quot;small tremor&quot;. your preparedness is most impressive.
@peter_r_bailey what a great set of tips! you should retweet these before next year&#39;s deadline.

@DataJunkie i think about this problem often, esp. when sitting at a red light w/ 20 other cars for 5 mins, while 0 cars pass thru the green
this &quot;Bing is cheating&quot; argument is nothing more than a negative PR attack, in my opinion
MS has been heavily publishing about their use of toolbar data for ranking for the past 5 years. so how is this surprising?
@jelsas yeah, i agree with you there. they certainly could&#39;ve done a better job at making it less obvious
The deadline for #ictir2013 papers (and tutorials) has been extended to May 1st. Posters now due May 3rd.
@craig_macdonald @HCIR_GeneG @lintool Thanks for pointing this out, Craig, and for reporting it to Springer, Gene!
@ian_soboroff you should expect an angry mob of teenage girls waiting for you after work.
@RojaBandari congratulations! and thanks again for all the help w/ the RIPS team this summer. best of luck in the future.
reasons why I reject your IR paper: poor evaluation (70%), lack of novelty (10%), flawed methodology (10%), bad motivation (5%), other (5%)

@jelsas ah, that&#39;s not the most well-tested code, i don&#39;t think. do you really need to merge? most indri cmds allow multiple index locations

Three #sigir2011 papers accepted (2 w/ @lintool and 1 w/ @bemikelive).
@diazf_y i find it much more of an honor to be the recipient of your first tweet than to have the papers accepted :) did you have any luck?
@iadh are there any good comprehensive (e.g., survey) papers covering the latest and greatest advances in blog-related search tasks?
@lintool I was semi-expecting you to announce that you were leaving for good. I was close :) What does this mean for your grants+students?

*@ian_soboroff i always thought the dot was informal, user-defined syntax. is it functionally any different than the syntax i used here?

@bemikelive glad to see that you survived the tornado?
@nimatwtr you just learned tech industry rule #1: never show up before 10am. the other option is to show up just in time for lunch.
maybe it&#39;s because i&#39;m getting older, or lamer, but it&#39;s going to take a lot more than having an &quot;in-house kegerator&quot; to join your startup.
my outgoing email server apparently has a &quot;bad reputation&quot;, which results in my outgoing emails being marked as spam or being bounced. fun.
