@tinyFey just send me an email with your resume and any other pertinent information -- thanks!
@lintool @abdur does twitter even have product that does event detection? trending topics != events.
i used to think the limit (as t -&gt; infinity) of unread emails in my inbox was convergent, but recent evidence refutes that hypothesis.
dear @KAYAK, please stop with the horrible &quot;personalized&quot; contextual ads about beijing travel deals. i&#39;ve already gone there and returned.
@jerepick I suppose businessmen exhibit travel destination burstiness. However, my travel destination distribution is much more uniform :)

today&#39;s deadlines: #wsdm2012 papers and TREC microblog track runs.
just submitted our @trecmicroblog runs. i look forward to seeing what approaches other groups took. #trec2011
WSDM submissions flat year-over-year -- 290 for #wsdm2010, 381 for #wsdm2011, and 367 for #wsdm2012
@iadh Last year may have also attracted more papers from Asia. I wonder if SIGIR will see a similar trend from this year to next.
@jteevan The number I quoted was from the &quot;Reviewer Instructions&quot; email sent by the 2011 PC chairs. Prob a few papers dropped during review.
@web_miner i&#39;d personally like a set of knobs that let me trade off personal relevance, network relevance, and recency (cc @twittersearch)

@nimatwtr every time i feel down, i just read your tweet stream, and it makes me feel a lot better.
i noticed a variable number of spam bots follow me each time i tweet. i wonder if it&#39;s random or has to do w/ specific keywords. let&#39;s test.
seo, sem, search engines, marketing, analytics, optimization, ads, advertising, ranking, web site, services, google, yahoo, bing, first page
@ian_soboroff you&#39;re right. that strangely netted me 3 legit followers and just 2 spam bots. weird. maybe not the right set of topic words.
@ian_soboroff maybe something like &quot;where can i buy twitter and facebook followers and grow my network ?&quot; will be more effective.
@diazf_y feel much shaking there?
@diazf_y that&#39;s clearly the only plausible explanation for this quake and the one in CO last night.
@BenCarterette was that your warm welcome home from Russia?
@stuartrobinson that&#39;s a great title for an IR book (or a SIGIR tutorial...)
dumb question: what&#39;s the correct usage of &quot;toward&quot; vs &quot;towards&quot;? the copy edits for a manuscript i&#39;m preparing suggest i have no idea.
@jerepick they changed all of my &quot;towards&quot; to &quot;toward&quot;. maybe they just wanted to save ink to lower costs.
@stuartrobinson Interesting! Perhaps it&#39;s a regional (NW PA) thing. I was raised to say other bizarre things like &quot;what do you taste for?&quot;
@delsweil &quot;toward&quot; just sounds funny to me. i guess i&#39;m more british than i knew :)
@stuartrobinson Yeah. That&#39;s another one I never realized was weird until I told someone &quot;my car needs washed&quot;.
@ian_soboroff unlike you, i can&#39;t even construct an s-less tweet. i look forward to your s-less SIGIR paper next year.
another well-executed LA machine learning meetup today. kudos to @petricek and @zaxtax
now that the initial google+ buzz has died down, my stream is more like a slow drip only worth checking once or twice a week, at most.
@XplusOne good question! i was trying to determine what types of keywords are most targeted by spambots.
.@davidandrzej interesting work! will definitely read the paper. (fwiw, i would strongly recommend to never use the indri &quot;#not&quot; operator)
@arjenpdevries i was responsible for L8 and L15. unfortunately, i haven&#39;t seen anyone actually use these in any papers.
@arjenpdevries btw, if you have a particular data need, you can always ping someone in y! and they can try to get it released for you.
elevators should require a special &quot;i&#39;m unable to climb stairs&quot; access card for all rides between floors n and n+1 (or n-1).
4.2 earthquake in the san fernando valley. very light shaking here in marina del rey.
@HCIR_GeneG i&#39;m guessing a small %. most are likely random junk, strange misspellings, and bizarre long queries.
i&#39;m co-chairing the #ictir2011 best paper award committee. we have a strong, diverse pool of candidates to choose from.

@ian_soboroff you mean, other than government red tape?
@ian_soboroff 10 years at NIST?
@ian_soboroff that&#39;s a nice milestone, btw. only 40 more years until the coveted CD-534.
@stuartrobinson awesome. thanks for the pointer!
attending the southern california machine learning workshop at UC irvine
my socal machine learning workshop slides: http://bit.ly/q5QAN4&nbsp; . asks what&#39;s more important for learning to rank - features or models?
it&#39;s only 10am and i already don&#39;t want to eat any more mooncake this year.
@lintool that was exactly my argument. no need for incremental modeling improvements when you have lots of data and strong features.
@jerepick yes, excellent point! if the language is expressive enough then the distinction begins to blur such that query = features + model
@lintool that&#39;s exactly what i thought... at least it&#39;s a step in the right direction.
@ian_soboroff @trecmicroblog did i miss something or has there been some sort of delay?
it&#39;s a longshot, but... does anyone in los angeles know if book royalties necessitate a business tax registration certificate? #la #dtla
mostly happy with our @trecmicroblog results. we kept it simple and combined a number of proven techniques w/ domain-specific adaptations.
@milesEfron i look forward to reading your notebook paper! i wish we had found the time to do something a bit more risky ourselves.
my first patent was recently granted (US 8,005,845). basic idea: &quot;intent-adaptive machine learned query-biased summarization&quot;
twitter started randomly(?) dropping posts made by my followers from my timeline. i&#39;ve missed a few &quot;important&quot; messages as a result.
@web_miner yes, but when combined they gives rise to a very specific (yet broadly defined) &quot;invention&quot; (that yahoo now has little use for.)
#twitter segmentation #fail... trending topic &quot;Ask Don&quot; as in... &quot;don&#39;t ASK, DON&#39;t tell&quot;.
http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-board-not-looking-for-ceo-2011-9&nbsp;â€¦ ... Yahoo! Research =&gt; News Corp Research? Doesn&#39;t have quite the same ring to it.
i&#39;m not a fan of facebook&#39;s redesign, but i do like their new open graph features. nice, simple way to add basic semantics to web content
@arjenpdevries you can add the tags to any web page. e.g., you can appify your publications page with &quot;+Read It&quot; buttons if you so choose
@arjenpdevries @diazf_y i wouldnt actually use this myself, but will gladly scrape other&#39;s &quot;open graph&quot; content as a rich source of evidence
another Twitter trending topic gem (for Los Angeles): &quot;Tomorrow is Friday&quot; (trending on Friday, go figure)
do any search toolkits support per-tag weighting? i want to have &lt;tag wt=&quot;3&quot;&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt; in the text and use 3 during ranking. @TerrierTeam ?
@pbrane thanks! low-level custom code isn&#39;t a problem. better than the complexities of implementing new index data structures myself.
@craig_macdonald thanks, craig. indri supports the same. the problem with that solution is variable # of tags per doc (think anchor text)
@craig_macdonald if terrier implemented that, then you might make a convert out of me, afterall ;)
@craig_macdonald unfortunately, no. weights will be arbitrary real-values in no way connected to the TF (or IDF) of the span&#39;s text.
@arjenpdevries nope, the weights are static and computed prior to indexing.
do any cities have a &quot;smart grid&quot; of traffic signals? LA could seriously use some more sensors + intelligence to improve system-wide flow.
@CathyE nice -- thanks for the pointer!
@HCIR_GeneG my pet peeve: when dozens of cars end up waiting at a red light for &gt; 3 minutes, while zero cars pass through the green light
@jelsas depends on how you define &quot;open&quot;. most publishers (ACM, Elsevier) allow posting to personal web sites. WWW used to put PDFs on web
there&#39;s a fine line between being too busy and being utterly incompetent
@julian_urbano successful procrastination is an art :)
@diazf_y @twittersearch furthermore, [can] should not match [can&#39;t].
my interest in a given seminar is inversely proportional to the number of reminder emails i receive about it
@julian_urbano i wonder if they would accept a scanned hand-written PDF.
when using NER annotator w/ latest @stanfordnlp, set ner.useSUTime prop to false to avoid endless exceptions/warnings for docs w/o date tags
@stanfordnlp It is useful for docs w/ timestamps. BTW, not all msgs are just &quot;logging&quot;. I got a NullPointerException @ SUTime.java:1707.

does #pandora serve anyone else geo-targeted ads for completely random midwestern cities that nobody&#39;s ever heard of? or is it just me?
@diazf_y i did spend four years in terre haute, indiana. i&#39;m thankfully avoided picking up a taste for ICP (or PCP, for that matter.)
@i_am_researcher i was of course only joking. i hope to give it a try when i have a few free minutes.

@kohlschuetter thanks for the support! i&#39;m guessing nothing will ever come of it, but it&#39;s certainly worth trying to get resolved.
@stuartrobinson @SebastianThrun key metrics: intelligence vs. propensity to cheat in both populations. too many unknowns to say for sure.

@kunegis thanks!
@kohlschuetter @diazf_y regarding the &quot;+&quot; operator issue. google rolled out &quot;verbatim search&quot; today (http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/11/search-using-your-terms-verbatim.html&nbsp;â€¦)
@diazf_y i&#39;d be interested in your findings, as well. don&#39;t know of too many IR-specific query languages, really, or user-facing studies.
@diazf_y google should adopt an indri-style query language. #verbatim(inquery stopword list)
@cherhan @julian_urbano @iadh unfortunately not at TREC. like this idea. perhaps tie w/ news feed (eg &quot;predicting tomorrow&#39;s headlines&quot;)
@arjenpdevries no, you&#39;re absolutely correct. the inquery folks deserve all the credit!

despite the fact i only tweet about geek-laden topics, twitter insists on suggesting i follow chris brown, snoop dogg, and trey songz
@ian_soboroff that strategy seems to have moved me from the space of NBA players to R&amp;B singers. it&#39;ll be interesting to see what&#39;s next.
@lintool is this subtle foreshadowing?
&quot;who to follow&quot; #fail continues. after nba players and r&amp;b singers, i now get actors (sheen, hill) and something called &quot;tap pet hotel&quot;
@DataJunkie i&#39;m not sure if this is bad matching, bad CF, bad personalization, incognito &quot;promoted&quot; suggestions, or something else entirely.

@stanfordnlp i strategically managed to open source mavuno before i left, so i plan to continue maintaining/developing it.

@HCIR_GeneG nope. much more interesting than that :) we retrieve structured representations of events in response to ad hoc search queries
@HCIR_GeneG technically, it can be as few as 1, but realistically you want enough to generate a good summary of the event
@stuartrobinson of course. but since this is an academic paper you have to make it sound overly fancy / general :)
@francesco1986_ yep. event query =&gt; burst detection =&gt; temporal query expansion =&gt; tweet retrieval =&gt; generate &quot;structured&quot; results

@ian_soboroff perks: increased awareness of exciting government processes you probably never knew about (e.g., continuing resolutions).

@sgouws how long will you be in LA?
@sgouws yeah, i&#39;ll be around the whole time. you should stop by for lunch w/ me and @congxing.

@jcmayfield the tweeter&#39;s dilemma: to actually make sense or to make sure your tweet is discoverable? i obviously chose the latter.
@fdiaz_msr yes, of course. there&#39;s writing papers, and then there&#39;s making magic.

over the past year, the word that is most likely to co-trend with &quot;layoffs&quot; on Twitter is &quot;yahoo&quot; (i&#39;m not joking).
I apparently have one of the top 1% most viewed @LinkedIn profiles for 2012. However, 1% of 200M = really not that impressive.
@hintikka That&#39;s probably it. And the fact that probably 75% of those 200M people have probably only logged in once and have empty profiles.
@tetsuyasakai i find it amazing some japanese tweets characterize a 5.7 magnitude as a &quot;small tremor&quot;. your preparedness is most impressive.

this &quot;Bing is cheating&quot; argument is nothing more than a negative PR attack, in my opinion
MS has been heavily publishing about their use of toolbar data for ranking for the past 5 years. so how is this surprising?

@nimatwtr every time i feel down, i just read your tweet stream, and it makes me feel a lot better.
i noticed a variable number of spam bots follow me each time i tweet. i wonder if it&#39;s random or has to do w/ specific keywords. let&#39;s test.
seo, sem, search engines, marketing, analytics, optimization, ads, advertising, ranking, web site, services, google, yahoo, bing, first page
@ian_soboroff you&#39;re right. that strangely netted me 3 legit followers and just 2 spam bots. weird. maybe not the right set of topic words.
@ian_soboroff maybe something like &quot;where can i buy twitter and facebook followers and grow my network ?&quot; will be more effective.
@diazf_y feel much shaking there?
@diazf_y that&#39;s clearly the only plausible explanation for this quake and the one in CO last night.
@BenCarterette was that your warm welcome home from Russia?
@stuartrobinson that&#39;s a great title for an IR book (or a SIGIR tutorial...)
dumb question: what&#39;s the correct usage of &quot;toward&quot; vs &quot;towards&quot;? the copy edits for a manuscript i&#39;m preparing suggest i have no idea.
@jerepick they changed all of my &quot;towards&quot; to &quot;toward&quot;. maybe they just wanted to save ink to lower costs.
@stuartrobinson Interesting! Perhaps it&#39;s a regional (NW PA) thing. I was raised to say other bizarre things like &quot;what do you taste for?&quot;
@delsweil &quot;toward&quot; just sounds funny to me. i guess i&#39;m more british than i knew :)
@stuartrobinson Yeah. That&#39;s another one I never realized was weird until I told someone &quot;my car needs washed&quot;.
@ian_soboroff unlike you, i can&#39;t even construct an s-less tweet. i look forward to your s-less SIGIR paper next year.
another well-executed LA machine learning meetup today. kudos to @petricek and @zaxtax
now that the initial google+ buzz has died down, my stream is more like a slow drip only worth checking once or twice a week, at most.

.@davidandrzej interesting work! will definitely read the paper. (fwiw, i would strongly recommend to never use the indri &quot;#not&quot; operator)
@arjenpdevries i was responsible for L8 and L15. unfortunately, i haven&#39;t seen anyone actually use these in any papers.
@arjenpdevries btw, if you have a particular data need, you can always ping someone in y! and they can try to get it released for you.

4.2 earthquake in the san fernando valley. very light shaking here in marina del rey.
@HCIR_GeneG i&#39;m guessing a small %. most are likely random junk, strange misspellings, and bizarre long queries.
i&#39;m co-chairing the #ictir2011 best paper award committee. we have a strong, diverse pool of candidates to choose from.
not too surprised by the bartz news. she was one of the factors that caused me to leave yahoo!
@ian_soboroff you mean, other than government red tape?
@ian_soboroff 10 years at NIST?
@ian_soboroff that&#39;s a nice milestone, btw. only 40 more years until the coveted CD-534.
@stuartrobinson awesome. thanks for the pointer!
attending the southern california machine learning workshop at UC irvine
my socal machine learning workshop slides: http://bit.ly/q5QAN4&nbsp; . asks what&#39;s more important for learning to rank - features or models?
it&#39;s only 10am and i already don&#39;t want to eat any more mooncake this year.
@lintool that was exactly my argument. no need for incremental modeling improvements when you have lots of data and strong features.
@jerepick yes, excellent point! if the language is expressive enough then the distinction begins to blur such that query = features + model
@lintool that&#39;s exactly what i thought... at least it&#39;s a step in the right direction.
@ian_soboroff @trecmicroblog did i miss something or has there been some sort of delay?
it&#39;s a longshot, but... does anyone in los angeles know if book royalties necessitate a business tax registration certificate? #la #dtla
mostly happy with our @trecmicroblog results. we kept it simple and combined a number of proven techniques w/ domain-specific adaptations.
@milesEfron i look forward to reading your notebook paper! i wish we had found the time to do something a bit more risky ourselves.
my first patent was recently granted (US 8,005,845). basic idea: &quot;intent-adaptive machine learned query-biased summarization&quot;
twitter started randomly(?) dropping posts made by my followers from my timeline. i&#39;ve missed a few &quot;important&quot; messages as a result.
@web_miner yes, but when combined they gives rise to a very specific (yet broadly defined) &quot;invention&quot; (that yahoo now has little use for.)
#twitter segmentation #fail... trending topic &quot;Ask Don&quot; as in... &quot;don&#39;t ASK, DON&#39;t tell&quot;.
http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-board-not-looking-for-ceo-2011-9&nbsp;â€¦ ... Yahoo! Research =&gt; News Corp Research? Doesn&#39;t have quite the same ring to it.
i&#39;m not a fan of facebook&#39;s redesign, but i do like their new open graph features. nice, simple way to add basic semantics to web content
@arjenpdevries you can add the tags to any web page. e.g., you can appify your publications page with &quot;+Read It&quot; buttons if you so choose
@arjenpdevries @diazf_y i wouldnt actually use this myself, but will gladly scrape other&#39;s &quot;open graph&quot; content as a rich source of evidence
another Twitter trending topic gem (for Los Angeles): &quot;Tomorrow is Friday&quot; (trending on Friday, go figure)
do any search toolkits support per-tag weighting? i want to have &lt;tag wt=&quot;3&quot;&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt; in the text and use 3 during ranking. @TerrierTeam ?
@pbrane thanks! low-level custom code isn&#39;t a problem. better than the complexities of implementing new index data structures myself.
@craig_macdonald thanks, craig. indri supports the same. the problem with that solution is variable # of tags per doc (think anchor text)
@craig_macdonald if terrier implemented that, then you might make a convert out of me, afterall ;)
@craig_macdonald unfortunately, no. weights will be arbitrary real-values in no way connected to the TF (or IDF) of the span&#39;s text.
@arjenpdevries nope, the weights are static and computed prior to indexing.
do any cities have a &quot;smart grid&quot; of traffic signals? LA could seriously use some more sensors + intelligence to improve system-wide flow.
@CathyE nice -- thanks for the pointer!
@HCIR_GeneG my pet peeve: when dozens of cars end up waiting at a red light for &gt; 3 minutes, while zero cars pass through the green light
@jelsas depends on how you define &quot;open&quot;. most publishers (ACM, Elsevier) allow posting to personal web sites. WWW used to put PDFs on web
there&#39;s a fine line between being too busy and being utterly incompetent
@julian_urbano successful procrastination is an art :)
@diazf_y @twittersearch furthermore, [can] should not match [can&#39;t].
my interest in a given seminar is inversely proportional to the number of reminder emails i receive about it
@julian_urbano i wonder if they would accept a scanned hand-written PDF.
when using NER annotator w/ latest @stanfordnlp, set ner.useSUTime prop to false to avoid endless exceptions/warnings for docs w/o date tags
@stanfordnlp It is useful for docs w/ timestamps. BTW, not all msgs are just &quot;logging&quot;. I got a NullPointerException @ SUTime.java:1707.

does #pandora serve anyone else geo-targeted ads for completely random midwestern cities that nobody&#39;s ever heard of? or is it just me?
@diazf_y i did spend four years in terre haute, indiana. i&#39;m thankfully avoided picking up a taste for ICP (or PCP, for that matter.)
@i_am_researcher i was of course only joking. i hope to give it a try when i have a few free minutes.

@kohlschuetter thanks for the support! i&#39;m guessing nothing will ever come of it, but it&#39;s certainly worth trying to get resolved.
@stuartrobinson @SebastianThrun key metrics: intelligence vs. propensity to cheat in both populations. too many unknowns to say for sure.

@kunegis thanks!
@kohlschuetter @diazf_y regarding the &quot;+&quot; operator issue. google rolled out &quot;verbatim search&quot; today (http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/11/search-using-your-terms-verbatim.html&nbsp;â€¦)
@diazf_y i&#39;d be interested in your findings, as well. don&#39;t know of too many IR-specific query languages, really, or user-facing studies.
@diazf_y google should adopt an indri-style query language. #verbatim(inquery stopword list)
@cherhan @julian_urbano @iadh unfortunately not at TREC. like this idea. perhaps tie w/ news feed (eg &quot;predicting tomorrow&#39;s headlines&quot;)
@arjenpdevries no, you&#39;re absolutely correct. the inquery folks deserve all the credit!

despite the fact i only tweet about geek-laden topics, twitter insists on suggesting i follow chris brown, snoop dogg, and trey songz
@ian_soboroff that strategy seems to have moved me from the space of NBA players to R&amp;B singers. it&#39;ll be interesting to see what&#39;s next.
@lintool is this subtle foreshadowing?
&quot;who to follow&quot; #fail continues. after nba players and r&amp;b singers, i now get actors (sheen, hill) and something called &quot;tap pet hotel&quot;
@DataJunkie i&#39;m not sure if this is bad matching, bad CF, bad personalization, incognito &quot;promoted&quot; suggestions, or something else entirely.

@HCIR_GeneG i went through my tweet history a few days ago hoping to answer you, but couldn&#39;t seem to find anything. i&#39;ll look again now.

@ChrisDiehl it sounds like you are well on your way (if not already there) to having Pig war stories of your own :)

wow, the LA office of finance tax and permit division is so horribly incompetent. makes me want to flee LA even more.
i tend to overuse the word &quot;very&quot;. is there a psycholinguistic theory/explanation/name for this very annoying habit?

@DataJunkie thanks for the free advertising!
@sgouws very cool! it even correctly detected my horribly scripted \xi
udacity using search engines as CS101 is a brilliant marketing ploy. to actually learn about search, read an information retrieval book.

@HCIR_GeneG nope. much more interesting than that :) we retrieve structured representations of events in response to ad hoc search queries
@HCIR_GeneG technically, it can be as few as 1, but realistically you want enough to generate a good summary of the event
@stuartrobinson of course. but since this is an academic paper you have to make it sound overly fancy / general :)

Having chaired a session in the #sigir2012 &quot;batcave&quot;, I can say it was the single worst presentation venue I ever experienced.
@milesEfron I believe it was part of an underground parking garage that was fitted with portable curtains and a low quality sound system.
@xuexb i noticed that your tweet frequency drastically increased. no tweets == no bonus? ;)
@brendan642 stemming/spell-correction typically done contextually (at the word and/or char level). many possible implementations.
@brendan642 feel free to email me (see web site for contact info). would be happy to explain in more detail.
@gilelbaz i saw you at the google office last week w/ tom. was going to say hi, but didn&#39;t want to interrupt. hope you enjoyed your visit.

@ian_soboroff @n0v0id @HCIR_GeneG But if you&#39;re from Cuba, Iran, Sudan, or Syria then &quot;more information will be requested.&quot;
@HCIR_GeneG great plotline -- enemies of the state infiltrate IR community, get internship at NIST w/ @ian_soboroff, take over gov&#39;t
@zaxtax fast coreference is an oxymoron.
I&#39;m surprised how many people fail to realize this happened *last year* - Dennis Ritchie Passes Away http://prsm.tc/vBnJKG&nbsp; via @prismatic
@peter_c_william Yeah, it almost certainly has to be the result of blind retweeting.
Tech Titans Buy Homes in Los Angeles http://prsm.tc/J7WEot&nbsp; via @prismatic
@bradfordcross yeah, that was a particularly bad couple of weeks. i think that ritchie&#39;s passing was largely overshadowed by jobs&#39; death.
@bradfordcross @peter_c_william reminds me of academics citing papers they&#39;ve never read, and may have never existed (http://blog.codalism.com/?p=773&nbsp;)
@fdiaz_msr @tetsuyasakai sounds interesting!
I guess now&#39;s as good time as ever to start using Twitter...

#www2011 relevance and ranking track had a solid set of papers submitted this year. track acceptance rate=19% (vs. 12% overall accept rate)
@KushalDave depends on score distributions. 0-1 normalization and z-normalization tend to work well in practice.
@KushalDave here&#39;s a relevant paper: http://www.iicm.tugraz.at/thesis/cguetl_diss/literatur/Kapitel07/References/Montague_et_al._2001/p427-montague.pdf&nbsp;â€¦
Shootings in Hollywood and on USC campus tonight. This is why I !(love) LA.
@bemikelive I&#39;m surprised it took them this long to do this. It&#39;s all about tracking, err, &quot;analytics&quot;.
@lintool and the jobtracker runs out of memory in 3, 2, 1...
Gave a talk today at UC Irvine&#39;s AI/ML seminar titled &quot;Learning to Effectively and Efficiently Rank&quot; (slides: http://bit.ly/d7Of9E).

@ian_soboroff I don&#39;t think that SEO + AdSense revenue counts as a valid form of research funding.
@lintool i was having the same exact problem today.. my supposed stochastic matrix was not-even-close-to-stochastic
@bemikelive the question is as ignorant as the contestants. i&#39;d say the country&#39;s name officially starts with U, not A.
If you&#39;re in LA and interested in machine learning, this talk by Yan Liu should be good -http://www.meetup.com/LA-Machine-Learning/events/95951242/?a=ea1_grp&amp;rv=ea1&nbsp;â€¦
Don&#39;t forget that #www2011 papers are due at *6PM* Pacific time.
#www2010 relevance and ranking track only received 45 submissions, compared to 77 last year
#naacl2013 reviews done. lots of good ideas, but so many bad evaluations. doing IR experiments? check this out: http://bit.ly/R5Glgz&nbsp;
@blekko is a step in the right direction in terms of more expressive, powerful query languages. it also has some fun IR geek tools (/rank)
tracking the flu using twitter? that&#39;s so 2010: http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4748&nbsp;
For the first time in 9 years, I&#39;m not preparing a paper for #sigir2013. In other words, I had a very stress-free December and January.
@jcmayfield the tweeter&#39;s dilemma: to actually make sense or to make sure your tweet is discoverable? i obviously chose the latter.
@fdiaz_msr yes, of course. there&#39;s writing papers, and then there&#39;s making magic.
@julian_urbano @HCIR_GeneG i&#39;ve always wanted to try procrastinating, but never got around to it.
passagifiable -- the ability to split a document into passages.
note to self: do not accidentally click buttons in confmaster minutes before a paper deadline, especially when you are very tired
@hintikka sounds fascinating. i look forward to seeing the slides!
@arjenpdevries nothing actually happened, but i came close to accidentally withdrawing a paper
over the past year, the word that is most likely to co-trend with &quot;layoffs&quot; on Twitter is &quot;yahoo&quot; (i&#39;m not joking).
I apparently have one of the top 1% most viewed @LinkedIn profiles for 2012. However, 1% of 200M = really not that impressive.
@hintikka That&#39;s probably it. And the fact that probably 75% of those 200M people have probably only logged in once and have empty profiles.
@tetsuyasakai i find it amazing some japanese tweets characterize a 5.7 magnitude as a &quot;small tremor&quot;. your preparedness is most impressive.
@peter_r_bailey what a great set of tips! you should retweet these before next year&#39;s deadline.

a friendly reminder that the deadline for #ictir2013 full papers is April 22nd. for full details see: http://www.ictir2013.org/cfp.html&nbsp;
@DataJunkie i think about this problem often, esp. when sitting at a red light w/ 20 other cars for 5 mins, while 0 cars pass thru the green
this &quot;Bing is cheating&quot; argument is nothing more than a negative PR attack, in my opinion
MS has been heavily publishing about their use of toolbar data for ranking for the past 5 years. so how is this surprising?
@jelsas yeah, i agree with you there. they certainly could&#39;ve done a better job at making it less obvious
The deadline for #ictir2013 papers (and tutorials) has been extended to May 1st. Posters now due May 3rd.
@craig_macdonald @HCIR_GeneG @lintool Thanks for pointing this out, Craig, and for reporting it to Springer, Gene!
@ian_soboroff you should expect an angry mob of teenage girls waiting for you after work.
@RojaBandari congratulations! and thanks again for all the help w/ the RIPS team this summer. best of luck in the future.
reasons why I reject your IR paper: poor evaluation (70%), lack of novelty (10%), flawed methodology (10%), bad motivation (5%), other (5%)

@jelsas are you trying to modify indri or just run it &quot;out of the box&quot;?
@jelsas ah, that&#39;s not the most well-tested code, i don&#39;t think. do you really need to merge? most indri cmds allow multiple index locations

i was amused (and impressed) to see that google&#39;s spell checker can correct &quot;dawnuld metslur&quot; (via phonetic similarity, i presume?)
@Jeffye it would be even more impressive if it worked for americans&#39; horrible spellings of foreign (esp. chinese) names/words (eg &quot;buydo&quot;)
our #sigir2011 workshop on search and data mining in social media was accepted (w/ fernando diaz, ed hovy, irwin king, and jie tang)
attending a talk by ibm&#39;s chris welty titled &quot;inside the mind of watson&quot; -- should be interesting
going crazy w/ horrible mturk documentation and useless error messages...
@natala it may take a bit more than 140 chars, but i&#39;ll try :)
@natala 1) soft 404s in documentation, 2) CLT errors uninformative, 3) inability to design qual tests + attach to HITS in RUI
@bemikelive Congratulations, Michael!

Three #sigir2011 papers accepted (2 w/ @lintool and 1 w/ @bemikelive).
@diazf_y i find it much more of an honor to be the recipient of your first tweet than to have the papers accepted :) did you have any luck?
@iadh are there any good comprehensive (e.g., survey) papers covering the latest and greatest advances in blog-related search tasks?
@lintool I was semi-expecting you to announce that you were leaving for good. I was close :) What does this mean for your grants+students?
#LosAngeles ML &amp; IR folks -- i&#39;m giving a talk on ranking at the LA #MachineLearning meetup at eHarmony on 4/28 (http://bit.ly/fXmGt6)

*@ian_soboroff i always thought the dot was informal, user-defined syntax. is it functionally any different than the syntax i used here?
@ian_soboroff @arjenpdevries my guess: if tweet[0] == &#39;@&#39; then msg only appears in timeline of mutual followers, else it appears to everyone
@allthingshadoop fwiw, i think it&#39;s actually &quot;grayskull&quot; (i&#39;ve been watching way too many he-man and she-ra reruns lately)...

@bemikelive glad to see that you survived the tornado?
@nimatwtr you just learned tech industry rule #1: never show up before 10am. the other option is to show up just in time for lunch.
maybe it&#39;s because i&#39;m getting older, or lamer, but it&#39;s going to take a lot more than having an &quot;in-house kegerator&quot; to join your startup.
my outgoing email server apparently has a &quot;bad reputation&quot;, which results in my outgoing emails being marked as spam or being bounced. fun.
@jelsas amen to that.

@nimatwtr napa (for wine), brentwood (for fresh produce), muir woods (for nature), santa cruz / monterrey / hwy 1 (for scenery), or sleep.
@petricek nope, i&#39;m not attending the conference. my co-author @diazf_y will present the paper. you two should definitely chat.
i&#39;ll fortunately be leaving LA just in time to miss #carmageddon

@jelsas i may have accidentally pocket emailed you. i just got a new phone and apparently haven&#39;t mastered locking it yet. if so, sorry!
@nimatwtr it sounds like you chose a neighborhood with a healthy amount of &quot;character&quot;. i just hope you&#39;re paying next to nothing in rent.

@lucasjosh if you&#39;re ever in downtown LA some weekend (or evening) then drop me a line. it&#39;d be great to meet/chat about search stuff.
to avoid doing actual work i created my google scholar profile: http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bmXpOd8AAAAJ&nbsp;â€¦
