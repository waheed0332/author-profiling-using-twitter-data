Twitter people, I&#39;m proud of you. So many people are spelling Saltalamacchia correctly. Though I&#39;m pretty sure most are copying and pasting.
Will Middlebrooks must feel like the whole game happened at third base. I don&#39;t know how you get any sleep after that.
A rule is a rule. Also, I love the umpires available for a press conference. And Fox 25 is doing a Saltalamacchian job in this postgame.
What will get lost on that last play is that Pedroia is the man and so did not deserve this. #RedSox #WorldSeries
