Flirting at the grocery store. Shopping says I&#39;m responsible. My selection of trail mix, jerky and gummi bears says I&#39;m single. 

Nailed it!
Are you subversively mocking me, or are you actually enjoying yourself? Her: You don&#39;t date a lot, do you? Me: How does everyone know that?
Drinks served in bucket-form are not &#39;whimsical&#39;.

Do you know why they call me &#39;Hatter&#39;? Alice: Because you wear a hat? Hatter: ...No.
If Alice in Wonderland has taught us anything, it&#39;s that crazy chicks are much more charming in film than in real life.
I have one squeaky shoe. I&#39;m not sure yet if this is the worst or greatest thing that&#39;s ever happened to me.
Definitely the best. A squeaky shoe is the closest I&#39;ll get to a cartoon surreptitiously tiptoeing with staccato accompaniment... For now.
Yes, 18 year-old me would be disappointed, but 4 year-old me would think it&#39;s rad that I can stay up late and eat all the cookies I want.
I really thought I&#39;d own a pair of nunchucks by now.
Wearing pajamas outside does not make me a ninja, but it&#39;s a step in the right direction.
Happy discounted green-food-colouring-day eve everyone!
I finally tried out a snuggie. It lives up to the hype.
@meggyc4 Oh yes, it looks ridiculous. I wouldn&#39;t suggest wearing it out of the house. Although you&#39;d be my new hero if you did.
@Wedding_crasher Huge. I haven&#39;t been this excited since spray hair launched.
Her: Just try.
Me: There is no try. Only do or do not.
Her: Then do.
Me: I&#39;ll try.
Her: [profanity].
@jacklynatlas Thanks!
Why must all my girlfriends live inside the TV?
I don&#39;t grasp the intricacies of wine and cheese parties, but I&#39;m pretty sure this nacho/chablis amalgam isn&#39;t the intention.

It&#39;s not right that Cadbury has all the chocolate-egg-laying-bunnies in captivity. Where&#39;s @peta when you need them?
Also, the Cadbury people get really bitchy when you call and ask why they don&#39;t make free-range chocolate eggs.
@CanadianSkin Hard boiled eggs become miniature fondue pots... I&#39;d buy it.

Her: Well, it made me laugh.

I&#39;m not immature, I&#39;m a performance artist. I call this piece &quot;boy as girl, in man&quot;. 

The reviews haven&#39;t been positive.
Today I learned that the passport photo girl gets really bitchy when provided with unsolicited art direction.
In my defense, the shots were too contrasty to be documentary, and not emotive enough to be art. Where&#39;s your sense of craft, Black&#39;s?
Sometimes I feel pretty grown up and accomplished. Then I remember how often I use my fingers as a counting aid.
What do I wear? Her: Anything. Fashion is about confidence. Me: But I&#39;m not confident. Her: Then go nude. Me: ... yeah? Her: [profanity].
Today we&#39;re playing the office floor is made of lava, except the lava is piles of paper and I don&#39;t care if you step on them.#springcleaning
No, I don&#39;t have a costume. I was going to dress up as a mature, responsible adult, but I have no idea what that looks like.
It&#39;s not a suit, it&#39;s a grown-up costume. Her: That explains the marker stains, but the cape? Me: Batman&#39;s a grown up. Her: ...Touché.
You didn&#39;t lose your dignity, you gained quotation marks around it. #PositiveThinking
If there&#39;s a lesson we can learn from the Kentucky Derby, it&#39;s that mint juleps are essentially liquified amnesia. Has anyone seen my pants?
Few things are as aggravating as waking up to a spectacular ass day, then running into no one of importance the entire day.
The five second rule only applies if there&#39;s someone else in the room, right? 

Also, how long can pizza be on the floor and remain edible?
WOW. Dinner looks amazing! Her: AND it&#39;s all-natural. Me: Oh, that&#39;s not going to work. I only eat super-natural chickens. Her: [crickets].
11:11:11 11/11/11.

It&#39;s not fair that the freezer doesn&#39;t get to have a light.
Correction: Turns out my freezer has a light, but it was disconnected. I think it may be hiding something.
Okay, my freezer is definitely into some things. I just found a stash of chicken carcasses in the back corner. I&#39;m thinking voodoo ritual?
We need a Skype so your brother&#39;s baby can eat with me and your father. Me: I don&#39;t know what that means. Mom: Don&#39;t you work on computers?
Screw it. I&#39;m keeping it. At least this way my Scooby-doo lunchbox filled with jelly beans is &#39;on brand&#39;. I just made myself feel bad.

Whether or not pudding can be considered &#39;sauce&#39; depends not on what pudding is,  but how it is being used.
Incidentally, resist the urge to put pudding on spaghetti. Or rice. Or steak – any meat, really, isn&#39;t a good idea. Don&#39;t judge me.
Even though it&#39;s casual Friday, hot pants are inappropriate office clothing. Marvellously, gloriously inappropriate.

Dr: Have you ever abused drugs? Me: You can&#39;t abuse an inanimate object. You can defile one, though... you&#39;re not asking about that, right?
Me: I just heard a great joke. Her: Awww. Were they making fun of you? Me: Well, yes. But still... ouch.
Take away the sword and mad-skills, and a Ninja is just a weird dude wandering around at night in a black onesie. So I&#39;m almost a ninja–Rad!
Apparently the word &quot;ninja&quot; in Japanese, literally translates to &quot;spy&quot;. Dictionaries are fun!
Umm... for the record, I am not a spy – though if I was, I couldn&#39;t tell you. Quite the catch-22.

@PunchPR I think it&#39;s a slow loris, though I&#39;d settle for a monkey. Or an ewok.

I attempted to make my own spray marshmallows with an air compressor and can; unsuccessfully. What gets marshmallow out of...um, everything?
Annnd now I&#39;m sticky. The bad kind of sticky.
Man, I wish I had a Scottish accent. Then things would be different.
@actually_nate What if your hands stayed the same size, but everything else got smaller? Just saying... I might know a guy.
Gin for dinner.
Again. 

Being a grown up is rad.
Spent the last 20 minutes sculpting an ewok out of cappuccino ice cream.
Also, my waitress has a serious attitude problem. Must be the heat.
Here&#39;s the thing; a backhanded compliment isn&#39;t really a compliment at all, though I can see how people make that mistake.
Also, I was just referred to as an &#39;ironically cool collection of awkward moments&#39;. Eep.
Weekly ego-boost: you look magnificent in that top today. It really makes you eyes *pop*. [hugs!]
Dear old dude, I realize mobile phones are smaller these days, but the microphones are actually better. Inside voice, please. Love, Pete
Oh, you&#39;ve accidentally pressed the speakerphone button and you can&#39;t turn it off. Rad.
The only difference between a stalker and an eager sales rep is a bad suit. Well that, and I&#39;m not a sales rep.
That was a joke, relax. Yes you. I saw you tense up a little through the window.
Just saw a man get into an argument, albeit one-sided, with a goose. I&#39;m taking it as an impromptu reminder that things could be much worse.
Her: These dishes aren&#39;t going to clean themselves. 
Me: You&#39;re probably right, but I&#39;m going to give it another few days to be sure.
Drinking Starbucks breakfast blend even though it&#39;s dinner time. I don&#39;t just flirt with danger, I get it drunk, cop a feel and never call.
Love that sweater – very Jackie-O. You need a pearl necklace. 
Her: Yeah, want to give me one? Wait.
Two penguins standing on the beach, one says to the other: You made me get all dressed up for this?

Fact: A pretty woman will magically materialize the second I start aisle dancing to the muzak version Britney&#39;s Toxic at the store.
Fact #2: Any woman I see subsequent to Fact #1 will not introduce herself.
My pants are loose. Apparently the economy is so bad, even my ass is in recession.
Loose pants is a problem; I just mooned a boardroom full of people. Well, partially; I guess you could say I half-assed it.
It bothers me a little that my bum is an economic indicator. Ideally, I don&#39;t want it to indicate anything.
Though I suppose it&#39;s better than being a smuggling indicator. Eep.
And no, my butt does NOT want a &#39;stimulus package&#39;. Smart ass.
I&#39;m getting off track; I need a loose-pants solution. I hate wearing a belt with a tie; too ostentatious.
That&#39;s a lie. I don&#39;t do it because the only belt I own is a Batman replica utility belt. Don&#39;t judge me. You know you want one.
Great news! Current economic indicators suggest my ass-recession has bottomed out.
I spend way too much time thinking about my bum.

I&#39;m creating a new program on TV involving origami puppets that drone on incessantly for no particular reason; calling it &#39;Paper View&#39;.
I&#39;m already in talks about a network spin-off with a more diverse cast; rock, paper, scissors.
HGTV execs, I have only two words for you: &#39;Construction Paper&#39;.
And of course, a viable BT competitor; &#39;The Morning Paper&#39;. @KevinFrankish: watch out.
Also, I need to stop keeping fancy paper swatch books at my desk, even though I fold a mean lilly.
The sheer volume of people who do things the same way for no other reason than because that&#39;s the way they&#39;ve always done them worries me.

Raspberry yogurt mixed with chocolate pudding seemed like a logical combination. And by logical, I mean I had both in my fridge.
In hindsight, I probably shouldn&#39;t have accepted that wager. On the upside, the fireman let me sit on the truck!
My tummy hurts... too much candy. On the upside, I now have a nougat centre.

That&#39;s it. I&#39;ve been asked to &#39;download Twitter&#39; for the last time. If you&#39;re over 35, just get off the interwebs. Maybe try a book instead?
I just saw a goose goose a goose. Didn&#39;t know they actually did that. Neat.
I love weddings. They&#39;re so romantic. 

And by romantic, I mean I have a pretty decent shot at making out with that skanky bridesmaid.
If wearing too much cheap perfume got you drunk, this wedding would be a lot more entertaining.
For the past three weeks, I&#39;ve been able divide my dirty laundry into candy or marker-stained piles. Evenly. At least I&#39;m consistent.
Also, what gets candy and marker stains out?
Weddings are one of the few occasions left where mad chicken dancing skills are asset.

I know I&#39;m going to be productive this week – I even put my pants on before noon. At least I think these are my pants.
Hmmm... upon closer inspection, I don&#39;t think these are my pants. They certainly don&#39;t seem to fit properly.
Shit. My pants, just backwards. All better now. 

As I was saying, it&#39;s going to be a productive week.

Four people have asked if I was lost today. Each time I was within ten feet of my office. I don&#39;t think this new haircut is working out.

Mmm... You smell like candy. Her: Thanks, but it&#39;s not perfume. I just ate some gummi penguins. Me: I love you.
Her: You got me drunk and sick.
Me: It takes two to drink, my dear.
Her: Don&#39;t be stupid, it only takes one...

How many crackers does one have to eat before getting cracker-poisoning? 

If it&#39;s a box, I think I have cracker-poisoning.
Also, eating more crackers does not seem to cure cracker-poisoning.

It is not.

Pastafarian? Oh, I get it. Golly, your playful choice of Facebook &#39;religious view&#39; sure shows me how clever and progressive your are. Putz.
Ooey, gooey, rich and chewy inside. Tender, cakey, kinda flakey outside...
What? No, I&#39;m having a great time. Tell me more about your cats...
I love New York, people here give you directions even if they don&#39;t know your destination. So friendly.
I just bought a package of chocolate covered chocolate fudge cookie dough snacks. #godblessAmerica
I just ate a package of chocolate covered chocolate fudge cookie dough snacks. I&#39;m pretty sure I now have diabetes. And fudge poisoning.
En route to SoHo, tried to count the number of times I overheard someone dropping the F bomb; I lost count at awesome.
Best NYC moment so far: spending half an hour arguing with a stranger as to whether or not a horse is actually a unicorn-zebra chimera.
I maintain it&#39;s a chimera. And that crazy dudes on the street lack a sense of whimsy.
Fashion Week, Day 1: Women seen=many Women met=none Fashion Week, Day 2: (See day 1).
I&#39;m pretty sure whoever said &#39;consistency is a virtue&#39; wasn&#39;t single. [sigh]. #LGFW
Like every other photographer, I&#39;m in it for the chicks.  http://twitpic.com/4chlk5&nbsp;
An existence consisting solely of alone time interspersed with small bouts of playtime with happy/drunk people... I wish I was a frisbee.
Hey pretty blonde girl, can I get a photo? In a big fan. Her: You like my show? Me: You have a show? 

I love #lgfw
FYI, the Naked News people are utterly humourless about the irony of their fashion week coverage. #lgfw
@SavelSells Yep. I lucked out on career day.
I&#39;m thinking of starting a blue grass grassroots movement, but I fear that the grass is always greener.
Weren&#39;t we all supposed to have robot slaves by now? WTF, science? I want a robot.
During today&#39;s meeting I learned that I can fit two smarties in my navel. And that working from home kicks ass.
@sousveillance Nestle Smarties, of course. I also learned that 2 smarties equals one chocolate M&amp;M. And that one peanut M&amp;M gets stuck.
I never got a chance to eat Urkel-Os. Dammit.
Fashion Week, day one. 
Sheer-y.

My banana just squished instead of peeled. This is the worst thing that&#39;s happened. Ever. To me. Regarding peeling. Of bananas.
It&#39;s just sitting there all smug and thrwarty-like. Fucking banana. You&#39;re just prolonging the inevitable. I&#39;m going 24 on your ass...
Mr. Banana, let me show you all the knives and other implements I own... then I&#39;m going to slice open an orange and make you watch.
I dissected my banana in front of all the other bananas, in case another one wants to be a hero. Then I drowned it in milk and Rice Krispies
I need to stop watching TV an hour before I eat. Dinner just got a little too intense.
I can&#39;t wait until I&#39;m old enough to rock beige velcro orthotic runners with a brown suit. 

You, strange old dude, are my hero.
Fashion Week, day four.

Fuzzy.

Being a bar of soap would suck.
Drinking with a group of twenty year olds doesn&#39;t make me feel old; it makes me feel smart.
[sniffle]. I&#39;m sick. And the sheer volume of mucous I can produce in a 24 hour period terrifies me. Where does this stuff keep coming from?
Swine Flu paranoia benefit: if you cough in a crowd, it parts like the Red Sea - very handy when you&#39;re in a hurry.
Ah gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.
My mom just asked me what &#39;the webnets&#39; were. 

So, to recap: my mom&#39;s more ironically cool than your mom.
I had some very productive business meetings today. And by business meetings, I mean I ordered some Madballs online.
Why is there a bear on my peanut butter and honey, but not my bread? WTF? Yogi liked sandawiches. Though I gather he&#39;s not the average bear.
This is bullshit. When I&#39;m in charge, rocket-powered products will be cheap and plentiful.
Hello saucy little vixen; my outfit whispers come hither, but my social ineptitude screams Eeep! A girl! 

Chicks dig mixed signals, right?
The Dutch sure do make a mean cheese.
Eat anything and everything, nap for a few months, then wake to nice weather and mating. 

Squirrels have it all figured out.
Weekly ego boost: You, my dear, are wonderful. If you weren&#39;t imaginary intertubes folk, I&#39;d totally make an awkward pass at you. [Hugs!]
How come Yogi had a tie and collar, but no shirt?

And yes, that&#39;s the only Yogi-related inaccuracy I have a problem with.
If anything, wouldn&#39;t a horse shoe in your bum be a sign that you&#39;re not lucky?
My Skittles and M&amp;M bowls got mixed together. Now I&#39;m stuck eating S&amp;Ms. I should be upset, but I kind of like that I don&#39;t like it.
Wow. Escalators don&#39;t fuck around.
I&#39;m a barista at Starbucks. 
Me: You&#39;re just in it for the perks, right? 
Her: No, they don&#39;t give us anything. 
Me: I love you.
You have 2 earrings, like mommy. Are you a girl too? Me: Sort of. [sigh].

Damned perceptive 4 year-olds. Grr...
Along with women and respect, I can now add cable to the list of things I don&#39;t get. Get it together, Rogers. Soon. I need this. [Sigh].
The only thing that makes me feel older than plucking grey nose hair is being comfortable talking about plucking grey nose hair.
I think my Rice Krispies are broken. All I&#39;m getting is static; where&#39;s the snap? The crackle? The pop?
Great meeting, middle manager. But how do you expect me to expect the unexpected? If I expect it, doesn&#39;t that mean it&#39;s NOT unexpected?
I don&#39;t get invited to a lot of team meetings.
I&#39;m not getting drunk and gorging on pizza. I&#39;m carb loading for a marathon. Her: You signed up for a marathon? Me: One step at a time...
The hamburglar got a bad wrap. I think it was Grimace. I mean, just look at him; he&#39;s an anthropomorphized purple blob! There is no justice.
Hi Team,
Lamest. Orgy. Ever.
Cheers,
Pete

I kick ass at writing meeting recap emails.
Show me how innovative you are by ripping off someone else... does Bell not realize that we get Apple ads in Canada? Great job, guys!
Hiya tech support! My internet connection is down. Her: Have you visited our online support centre? Me: Have we dated?
@chesebrough_j That IS spooky. No one ever relates to me – it&#39;s sort of my &#39;thing&#39;.
I wish they actually made hero cookies.
Quitting smoking is the quickest way to realize that everyone around you is a complete asshole.
Argh. Fine. I promise to stop referring to the Royal Wedding as cat lady porn.

#RoyalWedding
How much paranoia is too much? Her: I think any amount is unhealthy. Me: Really? Hmm... why would you say that? Her: [profanity].
I&#39;m not worried. Sooner or later I&#39;ll find a girl that finds ineptitude and paralyzing insecurity downright charming.
Risky behaviour is the very best kind of behaviour.
Fruity Pebbles taste like neither fruit nor pebbles. WTF?
If they can get away with calling a product something it isn&#39;t, so can I – henceforth I shall be known as &quot;handsome competent adult&quot;.
Him: I&#39;m glad they got Bin Laden. It&#39;s a great day for democracy.
Me: Sure. Did you vote yet?
Him: I&#39;m not going to bother.

#osama #vote
My duster tastes funny.
These days, surprisingly few of my wild goose chases involve wild geese. Perhaps this means I&#39;m maturing?
Me: Happy Star Wars Day!
Her: [?]
Me: May the fourth be with you.
Her: [...]
Me: I know. [sigh]
Realizing the motorcycling season is over is sort of like finding out a relationship has run its course – except without the sense of relief
GREAT hair day – righteous moss such as this ought not be cooped up in a studio, however leaving would require pants. This one&#39;s a tuffy...
Maybe I&#39;ll just stand near a window and hope someone notices...
I don&#39;t think my window plan worked; the neighbors seem more interested in my lack of pants than my good hair day. Weirdos.
@MoreCoffeePls Pantsless videoconference... perfect! 

If more technology means less clothes, will I eventually get to ride a jetpack naked?
I totally take back all those times I didn&#39;t want to nap when I was younger.
If I sleep all day and wake up at happy hour, it&#39;s socially acceptable to put gin in my cereal, right?
Oranges become marmalade while raspberries become plain old jam? Come on, raspberry. Aim a little higher; you&#39;re better than this.
Also, we&#39;re out of jam, the only thing I have to put on my toast is a wiener. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to eat mock hot dogs for breakfast.
Okay, I lied. I&#39;m totally ready to eat mock hot dogs for breakfast – have been for years. I wish I had some jam for this hot dog...
@jinooky I couldn&#39;t do it. The starch-to-wiener-meat ratio is all screwy without a bun...
Fine, telling anyone who&#39;ll listen I want to make a My Pet Monster movie is not the same as &quot;being in talks&quot; to make a movie. Dream killer.
Times Square – everything that&#39;s right and wrong with America condensed into one square block. #NYC http://twitpic.com/4waqsf
@OwenMorgan7 Thanks!
I love Wal-mart; it&#39;s the one place on earth I can buy discount tube socks, gummi bears and still be considered comparatively attractive.
If you&#39;ve ever bought new clothes to avoid doing laundry, you might be a bachelor.
I need a new camera – this one makes me look fat.
It&#39;s martini night and I&#39;m on the rye.
First Japan, now this…
Accidentally using the wrong toothbrush is a lot like eating a urinal cake; gross, but minty.
I didn&#39;t hump the company&#39;s leg either - where&#39;s my treat?
Office policies be damned; my mistletoe belt is rad.
I wish I knew how to moonwalk. Granted, it doesn&#39;t come up that often, but I bet it would if I knew how.
I respect your willingness to stay hip by wearing skinny jeans. Shame about that ass, though.
Did the Carmen San Diego empire shut down, or is it just really well hidden?
A day and a half before Christmas and I haven&#39;t started shopping. I am drunk, though. So that&#39;s something...
Why isn&#39;t there a light in this thing? I think my freezer is hiding something.
I think I just got mind raped. Also, &quot;mind raped&quot; is now a thing.
Today I learned that the older I get, the less impressed women are that I met Snuffleupagus.
What kills parrots? 
Actually if it&#39;s not gin, never mind – we&#39;re all good.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that the pole gets credit; the girls do all the dancing.
Ankle boot muffin top is the very saddest muffin top of them all.
Man, I wish I had some nerf right now.
Is there a way to show sarcasm in email without emoticons? Me: Like... punctuation? Her: Are you being sarcastic? Me: We&#39;ll never know.
@MissBrittanyDow Thanks – it was nice shooting alongside you, too!
Er, no. I totally meant to put my shirt on backwards. Chicks dig rebels, right? [sigh].
Happy New Year!

My New Year&#39;s resolution is not to make any New Year&#39;s resolutions... dammit... I broke that one quicker than usual.
I got a cramp during my post-run stretch. I think I may have been doing it backwards.
iPod, from now on you&#39;re staying home. My sexy coffee shop chair dance seems to be attracting the wrong crowd.
What the hell was Waldo involved in that required such a deft ability to conceal himself in plain sight?
It&#39;s a little known fact that bachelors have over 200 different words for cereal.
Kids aren&#39;t legally people, right? I mean, if one got seriously injured by say... a snowball? Listen, I need a place to stay for a while.
I need a new signature scent. What smells like slightly effeminate immaturity, desperation and sandalwood?
Yeah, I&#39;ve been told I can be intimidating. Is it the cape? It&#39;s the cape, isn&#39;t it?
@dropthefish Indeed I did, though all I remember is the giant eyelashes.
@melissadavis SNAP!
Hot date tonight! At Tim Horton&#39;s. With my buddies. Who are dudes. That still counts, right? I really don&#39;t remember.
Motorcycling is one if the few activities that makes wearing leather pants and a helmet seem cool.
Never trust a bald barber.
GAWF! Burrito juice in my eye. I&#39;m not going to say how – chicks dig an air of mystery, right?
@mdirocco Thanks!
Well, it took a lot of procrastination, but I finally managed to finish the new website – WOOT! 

http://studiolit.com
I&#39;m not fluent in Portuguese, but from what I gather, my neighbours are. And hate each other.
There&#39;s a finite amount of time one can use an electric razor in the bathroom before roommates start asking questions.
Sashay, sashay, pivot, pause... *jazz hands*!

Best meeting entrance. Ever.
Approaching random Body Shop customers and whispering &quot;It puts the lotion on it&#39;s skin&quot; is not funny. Apparently. I hate the mall.
Today I learned NEVER to refer to management as &quot;the olds&quot;. In a meeting. With the management. #oops
This is my new motorbike. 
It is a tad rad.

I&#39;m beginning to accept that I may never be a professional gangster rapper.
Ever download a recipe, waste an hour trying to make that recipe, and then find yourself asking why the fuck you didn&#39;t just order a pizza?
Today I learned that while baking impresses women, attempted baking does not.
I see you complaining, but all I can hear is a muffled trumpet.
The older I get, the more I realize adulthood is just childhood without the need to ask permission.

Also, I had pudding for breakfast.
Hipster chick: A pithy, profanity-laden critique of the relative merits of a screw top wine doesn&#39;t make you sound as classy as you think.
A self-professed perfectionist is a lot like a child who asserts he finished cleaning his room. #probably_not
I&#39;m not saying I deserve an award for cleaning my studio. I&#39;m saying I would like one.
Who&#39;s winning the hockey match?
Her: Game. It&#39;s a game.
Me: I know, but people seem to take it seriously.
#Canucks
Who&#39;s your team?
Me: Uh... Cincinnati?
Her: The &#39;C&#39; stands for &#39;Canucks&#39;.
Me: Oh... Just kidding. I&#39;m rooting for Brooklyn.
Her: (profanity)
What do you call bad kerning? 
Keming! 

That kills at design conferences.
Walk of shame be damned. Henceforth, we shall refer to it only as the march of glory.
@steviepeters Stride of pride: brilliant!
Skipping is an underutilized mode of transport.
Huh? People &quot;make&quot; their beds? What does that even mean? Like, from scratch? Every night?
I think I&#39;ll help those cute girls by staring at them. Then they can say &quot;what&#39;s up with that creepy dude&quot; when the conversation slows.
@unreuly Finally, some recognition. [hugs!]
Innis &amp; Gunn ice cream float for dinner. And they said I&#39;d never amount to anything. Pfft.
#LivingTheDream
That molotov guy sure makes a funny tasting cocktail.
I&#39;m not abandoning my theory until it&#39;s been thoroughly tested. Maybe there&#39;s a particular *flavour* of alcohol that makes you rich.
Dating is a lot like cooking, in that all my attempts result in minor burns and epic failure.
Time well spent. Now I can add &#39;able to endure half-assed, superfluous PowerPoint presentations&quot; to my resume skills list.
Oh sweetie, it&#39;s not an &quot;apéritif&quot; if you&#39;re pairing it with pizza, pickles and twinkies. It&#39;s pre-drinking. Good hustle, though.
God I hate my arms, I hope they burn and die... wait.
Yeah, I&#39;ve been seeing this blonde chick. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work out.
Her: Bummer. What&#39;s her name?
Me: God, you sound like her.
I really need to make a friend named Huckleberry.
W00T! We won an award! Thanks @DesignEdgemag for a fun evening. Glad I went.
How will I know it&#39;s you? Me: look for the six year old boy trapped inside a twelve year old girl&#39;s body. Her: Er... oh.  She won&#39;t show.
I didn&#39;t &quot;moon&quot; you. I gave you a chance to take a photo of my ass and make a fortune selling it to TMZ when I&#39;m famous. So, you&#39;re welcome.
Happy Monday, Twitter! My weekend was an epic triumph of liquor over experience. I hope yours was as successful.
I eat raw meat, but only on rare occasions.
Evidently, a business meeting isn&#39;t the ideal time to discuss one&#39;s navel, but in my defense, there&#39;s some neat stuff going on down there.
Whoever said there&#39;s no such thing as a stupid question probably isn&#39;t attending the same meetings as me.
@Chantellecutal Indeed I am. Recent-ish work is on my website: www.studiolit.com
You try to give out some leftover candy to a few random kids, and not even a thank-you? Folks just don&#39;t appreciate kindness these days.
Socks wedged in the lint trap. My ninja undies were with them. Coincidence? Or attempted corpse disposal after drowning them in the wash?
Smurfette had it going on.
Me: So, what are your thoughts on US foreign policy?
Her: BWHAAALRGH!

My 10 month-old niece. More articulate than most of my dates. [sigh].
Follow Friday; is that still what the kids are calling it? Meh. @FinalFashion @Twot @AmyVerner @unreuly @CMYKinky @GeekiGirl #FF
Egad! I think I&#39;m developing a penchant for intelligent women – quick, someone tell an off-colour midget joke to make sure I&#39;m not maturing!
Happy Valentine&#39;s Day! 

I heart you forever and ever, imaginary intertubes folks. Hugs!
Mingling at a bar on Valentine&#39;s Day is a little like going hunting with a rocket-launcher; fun, but not very sporting.
Turns out interpretive dance is frowned upon as a business presentation technique. Also, no one appreciates a flawless pas de chat anymore.
My turtle&#39;s famous! Special thanks to @AmyVerner and @Toronto_Life – http://tinyurl.com/yg5u8mj
To clarify – &quot;my turtle&quot; is not a euphemism. God, it&#39;d be a good one though...
You&#39;re a broker; is investing in my future insider trading? Her: I wouldn&#39;t recommend you as a long term investment. Me: Wow. You&#39;re good.
No worries. Wanna hug it out? Her: no, I&#39;m good. Me: it&#39;s always about you, isn&#39;t it.
Headline: &quot;There Were No Losers At The Westminster Dog Show&quot;. 

I beg to differ.
Robot monkey, or monkey-powered robot? Discuss.
I feel lazy today. I&#39;m going to chase that feeling. With lunch beer.
FYI, today I&#39;ll be responding with &quot;well played, Sir&quot; regardless of what you say, because everyone needs a win sometimes.
A water-skiing elephant. Yes.

I am a cliché. With a big camera.

In Soviet Russia, puck shoots you.
@Alison_Potstra Awww... Hugs!
@paiiige Agreed; if you&#39;re wearing sequins, you&#39;re not playing a sport.
If anyone asks, we let the Americans win because they&#39;re our guests, and it&#39;s the polite thing to do.
I bet unicorn steak tastes like cinnamon buns.
Of course I&#39;m wearing a my little pony shirt to a client meeting. How else will they know I&#39;m awesome?
Sitting in a sports bar with 5 guys, waiting for olympic hockey to start is the wrong time to order a blue raspberry martini. Evidently.
Nothing bad ever gets served in a cone. #DeepThoughts
Chubby neighborhood kid trying to bobsled down flat, freshly shoveled driveway: you&#39;re doing it wrong. 

Nice helmet, though.
@twot Double sink?
Corporate exercise day followed immediately by corporate pizza day. Dear the management, I think I&#39;ve figured out a way to save some money.
What&#39;s the opposite of a freckle?
Bachelor innovation no. 27: peanut butter in coffee – it&#39;s easy, means less shopping and serves as a handy meal replacement. You&#39;re welcome.
Congratulations to the sports guys for winning the thingy!
I was told I don&#39;t share my feelings often enough. So, here: I love you, Internet... Though mainly for the sex stuff.
Really, Olympics? It&#39;s like you want the world to tease us.
Okay America, let&#39;s get this out of the way. No, we don&#39;t really have sexy mounties and giant beavers. And we&#39;re sorry about Nickelback.
I live every week like it&#39;s Shark Week.
Oh, I get it. Novelty hair colours tell the world you&#39;re a badass hipster that thinks outside the box. Edgy.
Research is overrated. Probably. I haven&#39;t really looked into it.
I wish my alarm clock wasn&#39;t so assertive. How can something shaped like Snoopy be such a pushy little bastard? Grrr...
&quot;I&#39;ll Twitter you&quot;. I love the way dads speak.

I would have gone with &quot;I&#39;ll social your media&quot;, but I&#39;m not a parent.
A logo is a brand in the same way a belch is an aria.
If there&#39;s an unfunny udder joke, I haven&#39;t heard it.
Okay, fine. My camera and I will take responsibility for adding ten pounds. How do you explain the other 195?
Flirting at the grocery store. Shopping says I&#39;m responsible. My selection of trail mix, jerky and gummi bears says I&#39;m single. 

Nailed it!
Are you subversively mocking me, or are you actually enjoying yourself? Her: You don&#39;t date a lot, do you? Me: How does everyone know that?
Drinks served in bucket-form are not &#39;whimsical&#39;.
Yes, I have inadequacies, but I earn points for the sheer quantity and effortlessness with which I acquire them, right? No, huh. Nerts.
