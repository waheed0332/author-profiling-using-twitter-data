@borbay There&#39;s also a claim that this somehow increased sales - dubious and without empirical evidence.  They got publicity though.

@educator4WI @DianeRavitch Your School Board is correct.  Class size *can* matter but not always or often.
@educator4WI I&#39;ve been researching the issue for years.  Why does a special interest study become the gold standard?
@educator4WI I&#39;ve downloaded it and will take a look at it in a day or two.  It is far more complex that a slogan. Agreed.

I updated http://arttube.blogspot.com with a review of the Abstract Expressionist show at the Jewish Museum
@audreychernoff  The Abstract Expressionists coupled with the Beat writers simply changed everything - yet there&#39;s a lot of public denial
@chrislehmann NCLB is self-perpetuating and an endless war on public education, it sets a bad tone
@chrislehmann - The new Philadelphia superintendent sounds incompetent from my reading.  Same thing happening in Hartford.  bad news.
@lonseidman You sure Biden&#39;s getting the protection and not the pizza delivery service
@chrislehmann I agree about Kennedy and NCLB.  It is a smear on his legacy.
@JoeTrippi Joe, why does the Democratic education talking points suck so badly?  Identical to W
@garystager Gary, the unions were complicit in NCLB, esp. NEA - rotten at the top, no?
@garystager Did you read the Dem talking points on education?  Same as W - sickening, not change I can believe in
@garystager Wow!  Great piece of writing.  You&#39;re alright.
@garystager Gary, Is it me?  The Democrat stand on education makes me want to vote Republican.  I can&#39;t stand this platform.
My latest blog entry;  http://tinyurl.com/6ftaa8
@garystager I&#39;m tired of alibis.  End NCLB, impeach everybody worthy of the process, and end the war. &quot;Change&quot; that isn&#39;t is just hot air.
@garystager I&#39;m really not a Biden fan.  As a Democrat who works 2 raise money 4 the party I am feeling disenfranchised by special interests
@garystager I like D. K. but he&#39;s way too marginalized.

@lonseidman lon your blog is kicking up an error in the widget column.
@DianeRavitch So why did you support NCLB?  What&#39;s the Epiphany now? Selling books?
@chrislehmann The accountability meme is the Democrats weakest platform. No change from Bushco and has been bankrupt for years as an idea.
My latest blog entry - Obama Gets &#39;F&#39; on Education Policy http://tinyurl.com/57ocge
@garystager Gary, if McCain/Palin kill NCLB and states are free to innovate in education they are far superior to another four years of NCLB
@garystager Democrats have to insist that education be addressed intelligently.  It can&#39;t be betrayed by the party that knows better
@garystager Throwing money at NCLB simply means the fix is in.  This is not new ideas this is old corruption.  I wait on McCain.

@chrislehmann NCLB is self-perpetuating and an endless war on public education, it sets a bad tone
@chrislehmann - The new Philadelphia superintendent sounds incompetent from my reading.  Same thing happening in Hartford.  bad news.
@lonseidman You sure Biden&#39;s getting the protection and not the pizza delivery service
@chrislehmann I agree about Kennedy and NCLB.  It is a smear on his legacy.
@JoeTrippi Joe, why does the Democratic education talking points suck so badly?  Identical to W
@garystager Gary, the unions were complicit in NCLB, esp. NEA - rotten at the top, no?
@garystager Did you read the Dem talking points on education?  Same as W - sickening, not change I can believe in
@garystager Wow!  Great piece of writing.  You&#39;re alright.

@garystager Gary, if McCain/Palin kill NCLB and states are free to innovate in education they are far superior to another four years of NCLB
@garystager Democrats have to insist that education be addressed intelligently.  It can&#39;t be betrayed by the party that knows better
@garystager Throwing money at NCLB simply means the fix is in.  This is not new ideas this is old corruption.  I wait on McCain.
