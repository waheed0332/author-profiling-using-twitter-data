@ellenport @BaxFootballGuru Gordon King or Gordon Gravelle
@ellenport @BaxFootballGuru shoot, swore it was king... definitely OL... maybe Hughes?
@BaxFootballGuru Clack was really pretty good. NYG traded ex-#1 pick John Hicks (Ohio State?) for him and someone else, I think
@ellenport @BaxFootballGuru Not Pat Hughes?!  Shirk was 87...Tom Mullady was 81 and Russ&#39; Clack guess was wrong? I&#39;m at a loss.
@ellenport @BaxFootballGuru Wow. Great trivia, Craig. Was there but just a kid. My ride said it was over &amp; we were at car, heard the roar!
@ellenport @BaxFootballGuru bothering me... was sure clack or Hughes had it after &#39;78... #won&#39;tbeabletosleeptonight

Adrian Peterson should have coffee with Domenik Hixon, Jonathan Goff, Clint Sintim, etc., to talk about ACLs. Terrell Thomas can mediate.

When he did the Superman act in the EZ, did Cam Newton realize 3Q TD only made it 23-7? The apparent need to celebrate is plain silly.
No one&#39;s talking about 5 FGs for #NYG, 3 after stalled drives in RedZone. On their way to SB47 and/or Canton, they&#39;d better figure it out.

@BaxFootballGuru @NFLhistory Going with Randy White (I&#39;ll assume picking Andy Headen would bruise my credibility).
@BaxFootballGuru Definitley. Lost in shadows of 58, 53, 56 and 52.
@RichardBlais Scream out loud that there&#39;s a monster on the wing and when your neighbor wakes up say, &quot;Never mind... excuse me.&quot;
If he&#39;s cut, should #NYG target Ryan Fitzpatrick as backup QB? Carr is prob gone, team is lucky Eli has been so healthy. #Giants #Bills
@AshiLabouisse I swear I just read that on Tuesday from under the cap on a bottle of Snapple. Were you drinking my Snapple?
Novelists: To outline or not to outline? #novels #fiction #writing
Name a team that wouldn&#39;t give RD1 pick &amp; $2.9 mil per yr for Victor Cruz, esp #16-32. MIN just scored #2 RD1 pick, STL has a pair...
...#NYG could match offers, but what if too much $$? Extra RD1 pick would would help rebuild OL &amp; LB. However, Cruz may just want to stay.
If Cruz leaves, #NYG WRs: Nicks, Randle, Jernigan, Collins, K Adams, along with new FA (Cribbs? Welker? Amendola?) &amp; draft choice.
@RexPickett Good luck with Sideways NYC. I&#39;m in NJ &amp; WILL see the show! Also: Would you come over &amp; axe my door down,  get me back at work?
So Bennett to CHI. Automatic #NYG draft a TE on Round1? What about Adrien Robinson? Lots of LBs &amp; OLs to draft. Reese won&#39;t use #1 on a TE.
@Thirtyist Please put that on YouTube. So who will be behind center in September for those Bills?
@Thirtyist That bad, huh?
@bigblueview They must be looking in the couches for extra money.
@WilliamShatner Any thoughts on this first day of NFL free agency? Lots of players ready to buy expensive wines tonight.
For #NYG fans pacing nervously: teams making most noise were among worst in 2012. Giants will make prudent, calculated moves in due time.
@AlfieBCC What about Beatty/Bushrod deals?
So #TB in line for Revis and Goldson? Forget the negatives, that&#39;s instant upgrade for the #Bucs in pass happy NFC South. If it happens.
The #NYG losing TE Bennett not a disaster. Plenty of good FAs and in draft. But go ahead &amp; laugh: losing PK Tynes would create a problem.
Everyone&#39;s talking about Victor Cruz. Should the #Giants worry about losing RFA FS Stevie Brown (2nd-round tender)? Worth noting. #nyg
@kseniaanske I do that, then I go too far and wind up back at INsane.
@kseniaanske HYPERsane? UNsane? (Why am I doing this instead of working?)
Assume Carr goes, Painter not enough behind Eli. Possible No. 2 QBs: Fitzpatrick, Stanton, Feeley, Leinart, Losman, Campbell. #nyg #giants
@ChrisWGamble not a favorite, but better option than some others, and they need someone else. Really more interested in first three.
@ChrisWGamble True, unless Fitz finds out he can&#39;t get it.
@ChrisWGamble Definitely can see that. Matt Scott, anyone?
@kseniaanske man, I missed the announcement for this. Assume you&#39;re full up?
@kseniaanske next time, I hope
@ajconwashington What was the question? &quot;Can you help us through the math of your budget proposal?&quot;
Many have said Wes Welker is better with Tom Brady than without him... I think Peyton Manning can get it done. #broncos #patriots
@McMurphyESPN @jdubs88 Yeah, but he&#39;s a right tackle, so...
@ajconwashington Thanks, Daniel. I was being smarmy but also genuinely curious. Considering the question, his response was excellent.
@jamiedukes is excellent on @NFL_AM
@jaketapper @TheLeadCNN @SpeakerBoehner Does GOP have the Speaker&#39;s back or is he hamstrung? Is bipartisanship a dirty word in Washington?
Amazed that @LinkedIn hasn&#39;t posted anything about their own outage. Social media management at it&#39;s worst.
@thusgaard @LinkedIn Fair enough, but alerting users is fast &amp; easy &amp; part of doing business. They did post a notice, but a little slow.
Will Osi Umenyiora get a best-of-the-rest deal with MIA, NE or DEN, or will he stay put? #nyg
#NYG =solid B- free agency. Jenkins, Connor, Ross, Myers, Murphy, J Brown,   re-sign Carr, S Brown. Keeping Cruz &amp; Boothe will make it A-.
&quot;@AP: BREAKING: Senate passes bill to fund government through Sept. 30, prevent shutdown at end of month.&quot; Kick the can...
@johncusack @fenmaffei Rooting for &quot;Say Anything... To The Marriage Counselor&quot;
@markwitt32 @nfl @NFL_ATL @RyanWeiss2 Why not until now? Among most respectable guys in NFL.
Eli hinted that he&#39;d CONSIDER restructuring to keep Cruz. NOT pay cut, probable increase. Also said #NYG haven&#39;t asked. What does that say?
Amazes me that so many fans are worried the #NFL is becoming &quot;flag football.&quot; Fret not, your thirst for violence will always be quenched.
David Carr back with #NYG. Coughlin said his footwork, athleticism &amp; option skills help scout team. Will he run options in real games?
Suddenly seeing a lot from Michele Bachmann in the last few days. Who let her out of the quiet room?
When he&#39;s done playing, and #NYG fans will miss him, @davediehl66 has great TV career ahead. Excellent on @NFL_AM. &quot;Diehl and Dukes&quot; show?
@eaglescentral Not Alfred Morris? Doug Martin?
&quot;Do you ever get the feeling that there&#39;s something going on that we don&#39;t know about?&quot; #moviequotemonday
Let&#39;s assume Victor Cruz takes the reported deal with the #NYG. It will be interesting to see how the team makes $$ room.
@Thirtyist hj
@kseniaanske Wait. I have &quot;Tomorrow&quot; on my things-to-do-list for tomorrow, so this can&#39;t be.
@giantswfan hmm...
@DanParzych I thought &quot;World&quot; was his middle name, his mom&#39;s maiden name or an old family name.
I&#39;m still weeping over the #Heat loss &amp; death of the streak... NOT! NFL #Draft is 28 days away.
Film version of &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; (2001) references &quot;The Facebook&quot; at Harvard 3yrs before current Facebook founded. Trivial but interesting.
@RexPickett Was struggling w/novel backdrop/color, heard unrelated anecdote that uncorked it all. True &quot;a-ha!&quot; moment. Had to share. Thanks.
That #NYG will work out Pat White means one of two things: 1) They want Pistol/Option QB on scout team. 2) They want to run those packages.
Hey, #chisox are still alive in AL Wild Card race. Cool.
@RoobCSN THAT&#39;S a show I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m missing. Pernice is a pretty good novelist, too. You read it?
@ruhlman @AlyssaRosenberg Conquered!
#Rutgers so  proud it did right thing by firing Rice but missed chance in Dec. When AD caught with pants down there was no choice. #toolate
Should we read little into WR Julian Edelman&#39;s visit with the #NYG... or a lot? Victor Cruz still unsigned but negotiations ongoing.
@kseniaanske For me, it&#39;s finishing what I start.
@kseniaanske @Gion_Gion Write anything, just for yourself. One day you&#39;ll find the beast that once owned you... then you&#39;ll be back.
Just because #NYG have load of DTs it doesn&#39;t mean team is satisfied or &quot;done.&quot; Most have questions. Draft is deep at DT &amp; Giants love them.
@RantSportsNFL What is the &quot;New Jersey Post?&quot;
#NYG can&#39;t give V.Cruz $10mil/per now. He can only sign 1 offer, so let league set price &amp; match or take draft pick. Not a #1 WR.
...if he goes, he goes. Would be shocker but NYG would move fwd. Both sides want to make deal. Keeps eyes on Ravens, Texans, 49ers, Pats.
@EdwardNiam good luck to your linebacker! Height/weight/40??
@kseniaanske I found your keys.

Confusing, appropriate, heavy-handed or maybe disrespectful that the #42 commercial campaign features modern hip-hop music? Just wondering.
@fantasticphil @kseniaanske My first thought reading this: How&#39;d you manage to fight past the calves for a nipple? Yes, I&#39;m awake... Help!
Brandon Jacobs reportedly wants return to #NYG. Wilson/Brown get majority of snaps: how long before BJ snaps? Do #NYG really need headache?
The more I think about it, I&#39;d bet the #NYG wish list for Round 1 looks something like this: 1. S, 2. DT, 3. DE, 4. OLB, 5. ILB.
@Patricia_Traina Couldn&#39;t agree with you more. Hasn&#39;t anyone been paying attention to the team&#39;s M.O., let alone McClain?
Gravity of NE Rd3/$1.3mill offer sheet to WR Sanders proves difficulty of hooking others&#39; RFAs. #NYG Victor Cruz has R1 comp/$7-$11 mill.
@Schottey Are we talking great sportsWRITERS who cover the NFL or NFL news breakers?
@TheFix Why, is he getting ready for a career change? Interior design is a growing field.

Of all the #nfldraft details, Wonderlic scores should be kept secret. Paints skewed picture of player&#39;s intelligence. YOU take one.
Now everyone will freak over what #NYG GM Jerry Reese said/didn&#39;t say re:Victor Cruz. Reese has best poker face in NFL &amp; rarely says much.

Do #nyjets fans really think the team will do the right thing with the extra picks from pending #Revis trade? What does CC say? C&#39;mon, man!
@Mediabistro @AvantGuild @Star_News Just realized this?
@JoshNorris @PSchrags While that may be the pre-draft chatter... Two words: Rolando McClain.
The amount of draft chatter being taken seriously is mind blowing. #nfldraft
@Riles23 White Sox must still think it&#39;s spring training split-squads.
Could Utah DT Star Lotulelei slide to 19 in the #nfldraft? Would the #nygiants grab him? Mike Mayock just mocked OT Justin Pugh for them.
@AuthorLMurphy I study all teams. Don&#39;t believe the QB talk for Rd1. If he&#39;s there, Bills have to take OL, preferably Chance Warmack.
@AuthorLMurphy Kolb might be a short answer. I say QB in Round 2.
In the &#39;60s &amp; early &#39;70s, teams made #nfldraft picks in hotel conference room, then sent someone out to update reporters. #thingschange
Would #Giants be smart to bail out of Rd1 for extra Rd2-3 picks? If short-list is empty, you might have to wait &#39;til Fri night. #nfldraft
@pfref The Saints took George Rogers #1 that year. Talk about one team altering the future of another with one simple decision.
Teams looking to trade into Top 10 for 5-8/174 Tavon Austin? Either #nfldraft will be total chaos or some team will regret it in 2 years.
Possible zero RBs in Rd1. Some say RB position losing value in NFL. Hmm... AP, Arian, Rice, MJD, Gore, Morris, Lynch, McCoy. #nfldraft
Will Alabama CB Dee Milliner be this year&#39;s Prince Amukamara? Just wondering. #nfldraft #nygiants
@andrewzimmern OL or DB for NYG; LB or WR for Minn. Enjoy your shows/web/writing, btw.
Over/under on how many years until someone asks a 21yo, 6-6, 315lb left tackle on his way into the #nfldraft, &quot;Who are you wearing?&quot;
@eaglescentral I might argue for MJD and Jimmy Smith.
Four picks before #nygiants on the clock. Among the remaining choices: DT Williams, CBs Rhodes/Trufant; DEs Werner/Tank; LB Jones; S Cyprien
... along with TE Eifert, S Vaccaro, DT Floyd, T/G Long, T Watson, LBs Brown/Te&#39;o
@DrDave91 What are you thinking for NYG?
@Thirtyist Did you jump out of a first-floor window over Manuel?
@AuthorLMurphy Bills had a good Round1, trading down for more picks. Overall, this was a tough draft to project,so it&#39;s going as planned!
Whoever SF &quot;steals&quot; from #nygiants, there are still PLENTY of solid choices left.
Best guess is that #nygiants aren&#39;t crushed about missing out on Reid
@AuthorLMurphy No players, just one pick for more picks. Smart move, but we&#39;ll see if the players work out. Actually, it isn&#39;t boring.
If you&#39;ve been paying attention, Pugh is such a #nyg pick. #nfldraft
Te&#39;o just got a call from Chicago, but he ignored it. Thought it was another prank call. #nfldraft #catfish
@AuthorLMurphy I&#39;d like to hear more about that book/character... once this craziness is over!
Would Gruden STOP talking about the Honey Badger already?
@eaglescentral no
Everyone thinks Te&#39;o for MIN, but who&#39;s their best WR? Oh, no one.
@Jeff_Shull WR
2, 3, 4 &amp; 7 for Patterson? Minny, you gotta be kidding #nfldraft
Media created Geno Smith drama with lousy/lofty predictions. He&#39;s shouldn&#39;t be embarrassed, but ones who had him in Top 10 should. #nfldraft
@ChrisWGamble At least. What about Gruden mentioning Honey Badger?
@ChrisWGamble Would&#39;ve liked to have seen than... much as I can&#39;t stand listening to Gruden, he would have kicked Kiper all over Radio City.
My public library is sadhttp://wp.me/p1tURo-35&nbsp;

Shocking rush to find new home for #tebow. What&#39;s the hurry? Should wait, find team w/stable QB &amp; quality position coach, patient GM.
@DrDave91 Questionable, probably not, but I don&#39;t think he ever had the chance to develop in the right situation to know for sure.
@benshapiro But you&#39;re okay with ripping him to add followers &amp; increase traffic to your bullshit site? Wow, you&#39;re a real journalist now!
@DrDave91 been a qbs all his career, I&#39;d be shocked at that kind of move. Take years to learn nuances of DB, then too late.
@ChrisBarnhart @benshapiro No. His other tweet suggested Collins was a &quot;bad player&quot; because this was the only way he could get into SI.
@ChrisBarnhart @benshapiro &quot;Bad player&quot; is irrelevant. He took a shot at Collins - who didn&#39;t say he is good or heroic - for his own benefit
