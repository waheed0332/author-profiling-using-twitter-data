@AmberCadabra The gravitational sucking of rock stardom on the wane? ;)
@logosmith I wish. Time to get a better bag.
@arikhanson @marketingprofs I read #LeanIn and really enjoyed it. I had a few issues w/ the structure, but got a lot out of it.
@arikhanson @marketingprofs One of our execs hated the name-dropping, but can&#39;t say it bothered me. Enjoyed reading the VIP acknowledgements
@arikhanson Guess it just didn&#39;t bother me. I&#39;m very proud of my mentor, even though he wasn&#39;t famous. I&#39;d praise him to the skies.
@arikhanson @marketingprofs 2nd half of #LeanIn is a bit slower to read because it becomes a series of essays, not one consistent narrative.
@arikhanson But she&#39;s a chief exec at Facebook and married to the CEO of SurveyMonkey. I didn&#39;t really expect direct relatability.
@arikhanson Don&#39;t get me wrong, not discounting your take. I did worry that many women would find it too isolated a case to learn from.
@KatFrench Because we&#39;re guys or because we&#39;re nitpicking? @arikhanson
@KatFrench What, you don&#39;t think of me and @arikhanson as Rawhide men? Wait, don&#39;t answer that.
@chrisbrogan Probably when I lost my newspaper job back in 2005. A scary, optimistic, limitless time for reflection.

Have you watched &quot;This Is Water&quot; yet? (1.6M have.) Here&#39;s my Q&amp;A with the creators: http://adweek.it/12gXjLn&nbsp;
@girllostincity Probably depends how well you curate your sponsors. If they&#39;re supporting content you already had planned, it&#39;s a win-win
@girllostincity Sponsors always want to be in the content well, not the ad sidebar, but it&#39;s definitely rare they bring much of worth.

@Schwartzie14 For now, the 30- or 60-second spot is still the core product of advertising.
@Schwartzie14 In this case, I think the goal is for the Top 10 to have a clear identity &amp; not just feel like a recap of everything we cover.
@Schwartzie14 Originally, our &quot;Freakiest Ads of the Year&quot; was &quot;Freakiest Advertising Moments&quot; to be more inclusive, but it was just clunky.
@Schwartzie14 But yeah, good idea on the good ideas. Would probably be a totally different list, too.

Good Q. Seinfeld maybe? RT @caff: Where did &quot;Is this a thing?&quot; and &quot;This should be a thing&quot; come from? I&#39;m missing the context.

@caff I also saw mentions that Joss Whedon and Aaron Sorkin shows popularized it in the 90s. I can picture Josh from West Wing saying it.

@SarahDurdinR Title can be something like &quot;I am Head of Potatoes Sarah Durdin Robertson. AMA!&quot;  Then just answer as many as you can. :)
@SarahDurdinR You&#39;ll need to post &quot;Proof&quot; that you&#39;re the real you. Usually a pic holding a sign that says &quot;Hi Reddit&quot; or somesuch.

@allthingsfadra It&#39;s a short drive... @MackCollier could b3 here by lunch. @KerryGorgone @RobynsWorld
Hard to follow a class act like @AmberCadabra, but I&#39;ll be speaking at #typeacon on building your Facebook audience at 10. Should be fun!
@chilihead It&#39;s kinda sad that &quot;faking it&quot; has become synonymous w/ being confident in your own opinions, you know?
@chilihead And even sadder that many of those who believe they&#39;re faking it will never accomplish enough to convince themselves otherwise.
Man, what an awesome crowd for my session on FB growth at #TypeACon today. Great questions, super nice/smart people. Posting slides soon.
@MyGOMOM Thanks for the great tweets today from #TypeACon!
@Finding_Walden @goodgirlgonered Thanks for coming out to my session today and sharing some of the info!

Here are my slides from today&#39;s #TypeACon session on building your Facebook audience:http://slidesha.re/18w7Iom&nbsp;
@thesimplerweb Thank YOU! Had a great time today.
Ha, @ResourcefulMom just got applause for telling #TypeACon audience how to disable Google calendar invites unless you RSVP&#39;d.
@Jennifer_Bilbro Can never have enough things!

@Samsungtweets OK, that got a chuckle out of me. Well played.
@djambazov @theamytucker @phollows For the record, I can never thank you three enough for all you&#39;ve done to support @HeatherSolos.
Really hard to put into words what a great event #TypeACon is. Huge enthusiasm for learning and community, and a super welcoming vibe.

@gweiswasser @momadvice @Linda_Sellers Looking forward to your session this morning! Hope brand reps attend (and absorb) too.
Just starting: #TypeACon panel on blogger-brand partnerships. Amazing panel - @momadvice, @linda_sellers, @gweiswasser. mod: @chilihead
Brands looking for blog partners now focus on strong content and a wide-reaching network more than raw audience numbers. #typeacon
When bloggers partner with brands that fit their audience, readers often won&#39;t notice/care that content is branded. - @momadvice #typeacon
Bloggers should only work for free if there&#39;s a chance it could grow into a profitable/rewarding partnership. -@Momadvice #typeacon
I&#39;ve never asked bloggers to work for free, and no one else should either. It&#39;s disrespectful and short-sighted. #TypeACon
&quot;Blogger trips&quot; are getting old, @resourcefulmom says. Becomes less about feedback than about &quot;nice dinners.&quot; #typeacon
@notasupermom But there&#39;s definitely a huge ripple effect from the way 1%ers are treated/compensated. @ResourcefulMom  #typeacon
OH on &#39;blogger trips&#39;: &quot;If you want me to write a blog post, but want me to fly halfway across the country to do it, no.&quot; #typeacon
@thesimplerweb If you&#39;re doing brand partnerships, especially w/ agencies, helps to mention that you offer that service.
@thesimplerweb Most marketers think of bloggers and freelancers as different crowds, so good to show exp w/ non-opinion, unbylined work.
@notasupermom That factory tour junkets become seen as the pinnacle of blogger compensation.
@cc_chapman @ResourcefulMom I just feel that a multi-day trip is literally the most you can ask from a blogger, and it needs to be rewarding
@ScaryMommy Well I&#39;m glad/sorry to hear it! Slides are here, if you&#39;re interested: http://slidesha.re/18w7Iom&nbsp; Thanks for the note!

Want bloggers to help your nonprofit cause? Share why it&#39;s YOUR passion and get them fired up to help. -@allthingsfadra #typeacon
@ResourcefulMom I feel guilty take swag food at booths, so….grab me a cranberry zone bar. :) #seriousrequest

We are 24 minutes into Dad Blogger panel at #TypeACon and BatDad has not yet been mentioned. Waaaaait for it…..
@ColoradoMom I&#39;ll be there, Photobomb.
At dad blogger panel, @EPayneTheDad says he has no problem deleting comments from relatives who include real names in anecdotes. #typeacon
Good for blogger fams to have clear house rules, like @daddymojo&#39;s wife: &quot;Don&#39;t mention me in your blog unless you ask me first.&quot; #typeacon
@mommyswishlist AMAZING!
@MelACulbertson If I shouted my wife&#39;s name when she least expected it, I would get a foot in the neck. #baddad #capoeirawife

Getting schooled on photography tricks for amateurs by the wonderful @JennHethcoat  at #typeaparent
For pics outside, shoot in shade, not in sun. &quot;Brides get upset on cloudy days; photographers jump up and down.&quot; - @JennHethcoat #typeacon
@ColoradoMom Ha, wondered where you were hiding in this session. Right behind me!
@ResourcefulMom I should have busted out a flash. #punkrocklove
@Finding_Walden I also like to include ingredients that don&#39;t actually exist to easily catch people re-using my content. #protip #typeacon
@Finding_Walden *Tip: I like to order my gillyweed from http://BartyCrouchFiveFingerDiscount.com&nbsp;
Putting a thin black frame on photos can help them pop online, says @jennhethcoat (she uses &quot;dark edges&quot; option in PicMonkey) #typeacon
@Finding_Walden I really shouldn&#39;t interrupt you. You&#39;re my lifeline to the legal session.
@Finding_Walden Fair trade.
Never heard the word &quot;bokeh&quot; (artsy out-of-focus area of a shot) until @jennhethcoat&#39;s photography session at #typeacon.
@Finding_Walden I have a Samsung S3, so the bokeh area takes up roughly 100% of every indoor shot.
@ResourcefulMom @coloradomom @techsavvymama That&#39;s … just ….                            #nowords
@localMANDI NextGen seems solid - http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/&nbsp;… But can&#39;t tell for certain it includes article:publisher. Probably does.
Hey @studionashvegas, @tammyhart, @dougal and other wordpress luminaries - best plugin for OG tags and other social metadata?
@Finding_Walden Now I&#39;ve learned about bokeh AND light scoops. Thanks!
@MomSpark I&#39;m willing to take that risk. @momadvice @ResourcefulMom
@dougal @tammyhart Thanks! Led a session on Facebook metadata yesterday and now getting WP questions. Appreciate the tips!
@TheAmyTucker Earnestly, I hate that I couldn&#39;t do more. But it makes me feel better to know you did. @djambazov @phollows @HeatherSolos
@TheAmyTucker Yep, until 4:45ish
@griner Awesome!  Very much appreciated!!  #typeacon
@TheAmyTucker 1715? I&#39;m so confused. But no, not going to the att thing.

@chrysula Thanks! Great meeting you. Really got a lot out of your panel. #typeacon
Fond farewell to the #TypeACon crew. Best crowd / sessions / conversations / dinners / inappropriate hashtags yet. Will miss everyone.
@centsiblelife Definitely! Always end up walking away wishing I&#39;d had even more time with more people. Good sign of a great event.
@LisaJohnson Well, the hashtags became PG shorthand for things best left untweeted. :)
@centsiblelife Yes, tell @roociambriello to be more generous with her time next year.
Three days of #typeacon will straight up thrash your voice. Me and @roociambriello sound like &#39;Coffee Chat With Bette Davis and Tom Waits&#39;

@AnissaMayhew Just excited I got to see you as much as I did! Most time we&#39;ve had together in years - which sucks!
@JulieMPron Heard it here first! :) Glad to hear it&#39;s rolling out wider.
@Finding_Walden Per my far-more-brilliant WP dev friends: @yoast’s SEO plugin, OG plugin by @willnorris, and NextGen-http://bit.ly/12WNiWl&nbsp;
@Finding_Walden That said, I haven&#39;t checked any of the three for article:publisher integration. Actually shopping for a new theme now.
@Finding_Walden Yeah, good question. I&#39;ve been 100% focused on pub pages, but follower building can be good too.
@Finding_Walden Article:Author would trigger &quot;Follow&quot; button for public updates on your personal profile, if you opted in.

@cc_chapman @LPT Official announcement to come, but I have a hunch you two specifically will really dig it.
@TomBLogue To come soon! Wanted to give Luckie 100% of my focus until my last day, but now ready to get moving.
@AdLawGuy You can&#39;t shake me that easy, McSunas. :)
@TomBLogue Thanks so much, Tom. That means a lot coming from you.
@boyswithguitars Thanks, BA! Hope to connect again in person sometime soon.
@designtramp Thanks, DT!
@SGibbie Details to come soon, but it involves digital content, amazingness and skyscraper-devouring giant locusts. Well, 2 out of 3.
@mommystory Oh wow, how terrible. So sorry you had to go through that, but great writeup and insights on avoiding it in the future.
@brharrison Hahah, well, details to come. But yes, starting my own content strategy firm and making more time for freelance journalism.
@mareejones I like Hulk Maree! Where&#39;s she been all these weeks? :)
@AmandaLeePowell Corn Pops for me, but yes. Glad to see you still know how to live the lifestyle.

@HeatheroftheEO You two! Wish we&#39;d had more chances to chat. Will never forget meeting over dinner in AVL with @prairiemama
@HeatheroftheEO er, you &quot;too.&quot; I swear I&#39;m a professional writer. Just possibly one who shouldn&#39;t have woken up at 4.
@aprilwilson_ @roociambriello I&#39;m already sorta regretting this connection. ;)

@camorose Guess he felt conflicted at that point.

@Finding_Walden Was surprised how fast the day went. Can&#39;t say I miss meetings, though.
@RedheadWriting Um....here?
@AddisonDesign Got some email from Slideshare with stats. Otherwise, yeah, not sure where it would be listed.
@jvreeland Thanks, Jeff. Really appreciate your guidance as someone who&#39;s been there/here before.

Marketing folks, have you seen the #brandsonly hashtag? Without looking up further context, what&#39;s your take when you see that?
@KyleWiebalk It&#39;s from a real-world event, though yes, the online chatter has been hard to suss out.
@nickjayres Shh, don&#39;t get caught talking to us. They&#39;ll revoke your waffle privileges. #brandsonly @Szczepanik
@zacksyl People are getting snippy over non-brand folks using the #brandsonly hashtag? That&#39;s just ridiculous.
@nickjayres I have a feeling there&#39;s a big difference between the #brandsonly event and the way it&#39;s coming off on Twitter.
@amybhole This is an either-or thing?
@RyanAmirault So in your opinion, who should be allowed to use the #brandsonly hashtag without it coming across as mooching? Attendees only?
@RyanAmirault The idea of an attendee-only hashtag seems somewhat antisocial, though. Shouldn&#39;t others feel comfortable responding?
@RyanAmirault Thanks for the feedback. Interesting topic. Working on a blog post now.
@shaneadams Can you clarify? You don&#39;t see a problem with the hashtag being for attendees only? (Just making sure I understand)
@shaneadams Not sure I have a firm opinion to agree/disagree with. My concern is abt trying to limit who can use a hashtag.
@megmroberts Thanks for the feedback! As a consultant, former agency guy and longtime journalist on the side, I have no idea where I&#39;d fit.
@megmroberts This issue has helped me appreciate folks like @ESPN_ProdGirl and @JasonEng_, who didn&#39;t dismiss me at conf&#39;s b/c I was agency.
@kpiper Thanks! Definitely an interesting topic. No one&#39;s wrong, per se, but hard to agree on a right.
@ESPN_ProdGirl So my plans on being your office&#39;s exclusive provider of artisan pickled okra? Dashed. @megmroberts @JasonEng_
This week&#39;s #brandsonly event highlights the tension between vendors and brands, even on Twitter: http://adweek.it/1gZQft3&nbsp;
@JasonEng_ @ESPN_ProdGirl What&#39;s funny is that any of us can end up a vendor (sponsorships, etc.). Pays to be respectful on either side.
@JasonEng_ @ESPN_ProdGirl But for the record, it means a lot that I got to know each of you by discussing our passions, not business deals.
@ESPN_ProdGirl Most would probably agree with your initial assessment. But obviously not all. @JasonEng_
@JasonEng_ @ESPN_ProdGirl Ironically, I think I met you within 60 minutes and 30 yards of each other. :)
@CParizman No surprise there. Ninja/guru/awesomeness-catalyst are the stuff of consultants and startups. @YZebraDigital
@cubanalaf @shaneadams Previous relationship. Questions only. No links. Hashtag acceptable-use policy is getting complicated.
@SeanWRyan You pretty well just nailed why this issue first jumped out to me. No hunter likes to become the hunted.
@KellyTirman That starts to get into host/sponsor discussions.  Highlights my point earlier that brand reps often become vendors themselves.
@KellyTirman Most brand-only events I&#39;ve seen are organized by a vendor, consultant, etc. that wants exclusive access.
@KellyTirman Big client of mine was invited to one once, and he gave me his free ticket since my team ran their social. Event rescinded it.
@KellyTirman Hahah, well said.
@nickjayres It got waffly hot in here. Thanks for staying tuned.

Useful for the nonsubscribing freeloader. RT @nytimes: 3 NYT stories you should know about right nowhttp://nyti.ms/19ExhTE&nbsp;
Just announced: Instagram Direct will let you send images to up to 15 people privately. #Instagram
Instagram Direct seems to create an inbox of sorts for private images and conversations (w/ individuals or groups). #instagram
Only people you follow can send you #InstagramDirect photos. Pics from unfollowed go into &quot;Pending Requests&quot; instead of going undelivered.
@Becmwatts Direct message feature. Creates an inbox for private images and video.
@chrisnager Glad it helped! Not much more to report, though working on a blog post now w/ some lingering questions.
@jvreeland Snapchat for people who don&#39;t snapchat, mostly. I like the group discussion option, too.
My take on #InstagramDirect: It&#39;s about to get naked and spammy up in here - http://adweek.it/JaK8X7&nbsp;
@natjabber No, but I think it helps folks like me who have no interest in Snapchat but might occasionally want to have more private chats
@jvreeland That might explain why he opened the announcement with a long discussion of how feature phones outnumber smartphones 4:1
A subtle and appreciated improvement. RT @mashabletech: Gmail will now display all images within emails automaticallyhttp://on.mash.to/19ERuJ9&nbsp;

@arikhanson @marketingprofs I read #LeanIn and really enjoyed it. I had a few issues w/ the structure, but got a lot out of it.
@arikhanson @marketingprofs One of our execs hated the name-dropping, but can&#39;t say it bothered me. Enjoyed reading the VIP acknowledgements
@arikhanson Guess it just didn&#39;t bother me. I&#39;m very proud of my mentor, even though he wasn&#39;t famous. I&#39;d praise him to the skies.
@arikhanson @marketingprofs 2nd half of #LeanIn is a bit slower to read because it becomes a series of essays, not one consistent narrative.
@arikhanson But she&#39;s a chief exec at Facebook and married to the CEO of SurveyMonkey. I didn&#39;t really expect direct relatability.
@arikhanson Don&#39;t get me wrong, not discounting your take. I did worry that many women would find it too isolated a case to learn from.
@KatFrench Because we&#39;re guys or because we&#39;re nitpicking? @arikhanson
@KatFrench What, you don&#39;t think of me and @arikhanson as Rawhide men? Wait, don&#39;t answer that.

Have you watched &quot;This Is Water&quot; yet? (1.6M have.) Here&#39;s my Q&amp;A with the creators: http://adweek.it/12gXjLn&nbsp;
@girllostincity Probably depends how well you curate your sponsors. If they&#39;re supporting content you already had planned, it&#39;s a win-win
@girllostincity Sponsors always want to be in the content well, not the ad sidebar, but it&#39;s definitely rare they bring much of worth.

@Schwartzie14 For now, the 30- or 60-second spot is still the core product of advertising.
@Schwartzie14 In this case, I think the goal is for the Top 10 to have a clear identity &amp; not just feel like a recap of everything we cover.
@Schwartzie14 Originally, our &quot;Freakiest Ads of the Year&quot; was &quot;Freakiest Advertising Moments&quot; to be more inclusive, but it was just clunky.
@Schwartzie14 But yeah, good idea on the good ideas. Would probably be a totally different list, too.
