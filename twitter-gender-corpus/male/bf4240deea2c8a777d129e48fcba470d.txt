#xcpivot Steve Blank @sgblank reminds us startups aren&#39;t just little versions of large companies, doing the same things at smaller scale.
#xcpivot @sgblank: a founder is more like an artist than an engineer or businessperson.
#xcpivot @sgblank skype and phone don&#39;t cut it -- if you haven&#39;t seen their pupils dilate, you haven&#39;t spoken to the customer
#xcpivot @WePay cofounder @RichAberman explains their pivot into a crowded space. Hint: &quot;listen to the customer&quot;. Great little company.
#xcpivot @CherylYeoh offers an intimate look into the innards of a pivot: how @CityPockets turned into @Reclipit. Biz-tech-people...passion.
