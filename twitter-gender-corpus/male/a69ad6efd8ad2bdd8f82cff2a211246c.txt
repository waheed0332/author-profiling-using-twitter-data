It doesn&#39;t say good things about your program when a tight end makes a catch, shakes a corner and outruns the rest of your secondary.
Running left and pitching with the wrong hand right in front of a defender might be the most Taylor Martinez thing ever.
Playing chickenshit football on the road won&#39;t win you many games. Looking at you, Akron.
Akron is so bad. Bad players, bad coaching, and somehow should have won despite missing two field goals and throwing a pick at the 2.
Akron hasn&#39;t won a road game since I went to school there. Wow.
Can we talk about how @AlexHWilliams will handle the rest of the day opposed to how he would have if Akron had won?
What a god-awful decision by Johnny Manziel.
Oregon&#39;s QB just threw for twice as mamy yards in one half as Arizona&#39;s has in two games.

Flop a straight and guy calls down with third pair. Great except the part where board runs out to a straight and he has the high end.

.@KirkHerbstreit is on a mission today to make sure people know that Arozona and Arizona State are different. I like it.
Calling a personal foul with no elaboration and no number is the shadiest call a ref can make.
Off to Washinrgton vs Idaho state. Huskies are 49.5 pt favorites. Should be fun
So Ohio State gets jumped when it wins 42-7 and criticized for winning 76-0. Makes sense.
But at least ASU had that big program-defining win last week.
ASU is somewhere between above average and good. Somehow its fans got the idea it&#39;s better than that.
I&#39;m just amazed that after Ohio State dropped in the polls after a 42-7 win, Urban Meyer is getting criticized for running up the score.
Let&#39;s change that to what in the world are these refs in the Utah-BYU game looking at?
That was a BS reverse on the PI call. If BYU wins... Ehhhh
Good god this crew is terrible.
It&#39;s almost weird seeing the Cardinals line up under center and run in 3rd-and-short after Whisenhunt&#39;s &quot;tough, disciplined football&quot; era.

To be a little fair, Denker isn&#39;t seeing anything down the field. WRs need to help him out.
Arizona has no chance in this game with BJ Denker at quarterback.
Who&#39;s having a worse game...Denker or Riggleman?
Nothing says &quot;We trust you BJ&quot; like a quarterback power on 3rd-and-long. And he&#39;s not even the #ArizonaWildcats&#39; worst player today.
Solid decision-making from Denker there. He really looks like he belongs on this field tonight.
I hated on BJ Denker a lot tonight but it&#39;s not his fault the #ArizonaWildcats don&#39;t have anyone better.

Ohio State is putting on a clinic on how to lose games on the road when you&#39;re the significantly better team.
It&#39;s amazing that Northwestern played 30 minutes against the No. 4 team in the country without committing a single penalty.
Taylor Kelly said Wednesday that the #ASU offense was firing on all cylinders. So much for that.
Braxton Miller has cost Ohio State at least 21 points in this game.
I  REALLY thought #ASU was going to win that game something like 42-20. Oops.
Ohio State has to snap that ball instantly.
I can&#39;t wait to listen to people rip Ohio State for beating the No. 16 team on the road.
I&#39;m so confused about why Ohio State didn&#39;t give that ball to Carlos Hyde.
Yeah, give it to the guy who&#39;s the reason you&#39;re in a close game, not the guy who&#39;s the reason you&#39;re winning it.

I feel like I&#39;ve seen Shaq Richardson and Jon McKnight running 10 yards behind a USC receiver before.
This drive is all Arizona needs from Denker.
Lol Arizona kickers
Most of Denker&#39;s threat as a passer depends on run game. Don&#39;t get empty set on third and short.
It says a lot about Pac-12 refs that the third down play even had to be reviewed.
People calling for Denker to be benched - fumbles like that are the only way it happens.
You&#39;ve gotta be shitting me with that pizza hut ad. Who thought that was a good idea?
I hate the decision to not run on third then go for fourth, especially with a kicker who just missed a 38-yarder by 20 yards.
It looks like BJ Denker has been to the Denard Robinson school of deep balls.

@AlexHWilliams miss you boo
RichRod was so on-point when he said Ka&#39;Deem Carey runs hungry. Best way to describe it. Guy always wants the extra yard.
I think the most concerning thing about Denker is that when he sees pressure, his first reaction is to run straight backward.
Coaches can learn to work around the inaccuracy and get Denker in situations where he&#39;s comfortable. But I don&#39;t think panic is fixable.
Oh wow Arizona. Best throw of Denker&#39;s life.
Everyone should know by now that SHIT GETS WEIRD ON THURSDAY NIGHTS IN THE PAC-12.
Dropping that in between four defenders. Wow.
Second straight game this has been clear - #ArizonaWildcats aren&#39;t far from competing in the Pac. RichRod has them going right direction.
A little more defensive depth … a little more consistency at QB all it takes. No reason at all to be discouraged by the #ArizonaWildcats.
So...um, did anyone ever ask why the clock kept running when Redd ran outta bounds?

I think he&#39;s down but don&#39;t think it can get overturned. Two huge Oregon mistakes so far.
No matter what they called on the field it was standing. Not a conspiracy theorist but it sure seemed like someone wanted Oregon to score.
Awesome. FS1 is doing the commercial - kickoff - commercial that has ruined America.
What&#39;s that big bright thing in the sky in Seattle? I spent four days there and didn&#39;t see it once.

How in the world does a 1-0 baseball game with 10 combined hits take almost four hours? That&#39;s not helping the sport&#39;s popularity.
There you go Ole Miss, take 10 seconds off the clock and let the Heisman Trophy winner win the game. Brilliant.
Not sure why but I just don&#39;t buy UCLA as an elite team. Think there are three Pac-12 North teams better than them.
Run on the first two downs to get to 3rd-and-1, then go empty and throw an incompletion. Is Ken Whisenhunt back with the Cardinals?
OK, the Carson Palmer experience is over. That&#39;s four inexcusable throws in three possessions.
Wow. I was wrong. Carson Palmer isn&#39;t an upgrade over the dumpster fire they had at QB last year.
At least the Cardinals&#39; quarterbacks last year just hurt the offense. Now Palmer&#39;s putting the defense in terrible spots too.
Carson Palmer might be playing one of the worst games in NFL history
Two picks, a delay of game and standing in the end zone for five seconds before getting sacked for a safety. Quality stuff.
That&#39;s not interference. Corners don&#39;t get to slow down and make receivers slow down right behind them.
I&#39;m glad the Cardinals feel the need to run sweep/reverse/passes to a cornerback to pick up two freaking yards.
Also way too early to go for two. Almost a guarantee that will bite the Cardinals at some point.
So the 49ers get two personal fouls to the Cardinals&#39; one, and they all offset?
Sure is a good thing the Cardinals went for two early in the third quarter.
It never seemed smart at any point. MT @danbickley: Arians&#39; decision to go for 2 in the third quarter doesn&#39;t seem so smart right about now
Cardinals should be 5-1 and tied for first. Instead 3-3 and tied for last. It all comes down to little things.

The Cardinals failed to convert on third down and Javier Arenas made another god-awful decision on a kickoff. It&#39;s like why do I even watch?
O-line issues and a Carson Palmer interception. Couldn&#39;t we have just saved everyone the trouble of playing a stupid Thursday game?
Hey, look at the Cardinala getting embarrassed in a national TV game. That never happens
The Cardinals bouncing back after an embarrassing start is ACTUALLY something new. Good to see.
The Cardinals even get screwed when they get a holding call.
That punt where Peterson got hurt has got to be a penalty. How is blocking someone into a returner any less dangerous than hitting him?
That&#39;s 10 points the Seahawks have gotten through luck
The Cardinals have a bunch of good pieces on defense. The problem is that they&#39;ll all be past their prime once the offense is anywhere close
I don&#39;t want to put this game on Palmer, but then he goes and misses a throw like that.
#AZCardinals coach Bruce Arians says (again) that the interceptions aren&#39;t Carson Palmer&#39;s fault:http://bit.ly/177dPnd&nbsp;
#AZCardinals RB Andre Ellington had a couple gems today. 
Q: How did Seattle slow down Cards&#39; O
A: They did some stuff to slow us down.
More #AZCardinals Ellington: 

Q: Surprised you only got 3 carries?
A: Just kept giving it to Mendenhall (Avg. 1.6 YPC). He had the hot hand
@SpencerDanae Depressing.
The Cardinals are so good. So experienced. I don&#39;t see anybody beating them.

I would say this is another banner day for the SEC, but Tennessee and Vandy will just jump to 11 and 15 if they win.
The two people who I&#39;m in line behind at Subway are getting a combined 12 sandwiches. So much for thinking this would be fast.
That catch was unreal.
Ohio State clearly had a lot of respect for Iowa&#39;s passing attack coming into this game.
And Bradley Roby has cost himself so much money this year
I can&#39;t wait to hear Ohio State get ripped for Northwestern&#39;s loss while no one says anything about Georgia&#39;s affecting Clemson.
Yeah, don&#39;t let a corner hit a tight end in the chest. This fucking targeting rule has got to go.
Its fantastic that Ohio State can&#39;t stop an offense that&#39;s stuck in 1960.
Ohio State is playing like a very bad football team and it&#39;s going to lose because of that.
Yahoo! writes a story about Roby tweeting during the game, and commenters call him a thug and gangster. Keep it real, internet people.
Ohio State responded after halftime in a way I didn&#39;t think it was capable of doing. Great to see.
So, what do you think? Are the #ArizonaWildcats in a must-win 3-game stretch playing Utah, Colorado and Cal the next 3 weeks?
Bradley Roby gets ejected and this Auburn guy doesn&#39;t even get a flag. Way to be consistent, NCAA refs.
I was eigher WAY too high on Washington or they completely packed it in after the Oregon and Stanford losses.
It says a lot about the #ArizonaWildcats that the thing their fans bitch about most is the ZonaZoo. Talk about small-time.
The #ArizonaWildcats are tied at 7 with Utah in the first quarter in Tucson. Keep up with the action here -http://bit.ly/1gu67r6&nbsp;
*Drops mic* RT @TheCoolSub: That was a gift to Flowers. Which is weird cuz Flowers usually ARE the gift!
Arizona is stupid for not attempting a field goal there. TAKE THE POINTS
@ZachEClark Didn&#39;t Tennessee win that game?
&#39;Yotes Notes: #Coyotes score five unanswered, including Smith&#39;s empty-netter, to top Red Wings 5-2 -http://bit.ly/19UK9Ge&nbsp;
Why do refs explain why grounding was NOT called? Seems akin to something like &quot;there&#39;s no penalty for holding because no one was held.&quot;
I can&#39;t remember the last time Arizona had a kicker or punt returner. I don&#39;t get how a program can consistently lack the same thing.
Big-time downfield throw from BJ Denker. Imagine an Arizona offense with Austin Hill if that throw is consistently there.
I hate everything about going for 2 here.
I said this earlier today, but I&#39;m really starting to think the #ArizonaWildcats win the next 3 games then at least compete with UCLA.
Looked like a bad call. Somebody on TV confirm?
#Pac12 refs gonna be Pac-12 refs.
Also, Trevor Ermisch is playing the game of his life on STs. Two big hits and a fumble recovery.
I remember when he was like 5-foot-2, 110 pounds as a high school sophomore. Talk about a growth spurt.
#ArizonaWildcats Ka&#39;Deem Carey breaks a 44-yard run on 3rd-and-5 to put Arizona ahead of Utah, 35-24, with 1:30 to play in Tucson.
40 CARRIES FOR 236 YARDS. It&#39;s like Ka&#39;Deem Carey thinks he&#39;s Javon Ringer or something.

I think it is apparent by the first BCS standings that Ohio State doesn&#39;t control its own destiny. Needs a lot of help, even if unbeaten.

I&#39;m confused by hockey fans&#39; insistence to give players nicknames that are longer than their actual names.
A good way to avoid that penalty? Don&#39;t chest-bump the quarterback four seconds after the ball is out.

Especially after having more than a quarter of the chips in play 11-handed. I&#39;m mad. HULK SMASH.
@dailywildcat wrong link?
I think the Cardinals should trade Fitz. But from an org. standpoint, do long-term positives outweigh short-term negatives?
I wish the Diamondbacks scouted wherever the Cardinals found five guys throwing 100 that know when to go in.

6-5 starters and relievers throwing 100. If anybody has pitching figured out, it&#39;s the Cardinals.

The Coyotes are what the #Dbacks wanted to be with the whole &quot;grit&quot; mantra.
I&#39;m amazed that Grant Jerrett got drafted and traded without ever actually signing a contract. How is that possible?
Something I learned today: A lot of people don&#39;t understand what restricted free agent means.
I&#39;m surprised Glen Mason made it this far in life without someone telling him that it&#39;s Ohio State, not Hia State.
I miss Ralphie.
Jake Plummer says Ka&#39;Deem Carey will get more yards this week because he was suspended against NAU. Because that makes sense.
Now he says that Arizona&#39;s offense will eat up clock to keep Cal&#39;s offense off the field. Does he watch football?
Now @Pac12Networks PBP guy says #ArizonaWildcats have 3 straight road wins. Try one. Amateur hour every hour.
If I&#39;m Arizona, I&#39;m all for 3rd and 10 over 2nd and 20.
Or maybe I&#39;m just underestimating how terrible Cal is.
Great awareness, interfering on an 8-yard pass on 3rd and 20.
People like to point to speed &amp; explosiveness to measure athleticism. Ka&#39;Deem Carey is an unreal athlete. Great balance and body control.
How is unnecessary contact above the shoulders not targeting?

Oh my God did that really just happen?
Arizona&#39;s return game has actually been very good today. That&#39;s rare.
Arizona didn&#39;t really just run a reverse on 3rd-and-3, did it?
19-7 is such a playing-at-Cal score.
Does anyone know why Arizona seems to get away from the read-option near the goal line?
My god, Pac-12 Networks must really be struggling to sell ads. Seems like they have the same house ads on repeat
Is there a single thing that Michigan does well?
Arizona&#39;s defense does some really dumbass things sometimes.
Three Cal touchdowns, and two of them were on drives aided by a really, really stupid penalty by the #ArizonaWildcats defense.
Devin Gardner just made one of the biggest chicken-shit plays I&#39;ve ever seen in football.
I guess blatant pick plays don&#39;t get called in the Pac-12 now.
Devin Gardner just made one of the biggest chicken-shit plays I&#39;ve ever seen in football.
Watching Ohio State&#39;s offense against Michigan State will be fun. Watching it against Michigan will be fun too, but for different reasons.
Devin Gardner just made one of the biggest chicken-shit plays I&#39;ve ever seen in football.
If the #ArizonaWildcats can hold on, they can&#39;t ask for any more momentum heading into a big showdown against No. 17 #UCLA next week.
#ArizonaWildcats need a first down or we&#39;re looking at Cal ball with about 50 seconds and a chance to win.
I think not kicking it deep was a mistake. Now even if Cal gets the stop, a touchdown almost impossible with field position.
Glen Parker is wrong. Winning league games on the road is tough, especially with a big game looming next week. No reason for concern.
What the hell team did this guy research that has won three straight road games? Because that&#39;s the second time he&#39;s said it.
If you replace &quot;beach&quot; with &quot;betch&quot; in Corona commercials, they make so much more sense.
This game is as much about Miami not being very good as it is Florida State being good. About the equilavent of MSU beating Michigan today.
If you want to sell UO and Bama as a level above everyone else, fine. But I don&#39;t buy for a second that FSU is discernably better than OSU.
Beating a Clemson team that&#39;s going full Clemson and a vastly overrated Miami team just doesn&#39;t do it for me.
ASU has blown out CU, a drained UW team and WSU, but say #ArizonaWildcats fans are too confident from beating bad teams. Right right right.
ASU is ranked one spot ahead of Notre Dame in both polls, because that makes sense.

I guess this answers the question of &quot;how can a great team lose to Utah?&quot; Cardinal good, but not great.
College football is a better place when Lane Kiffin isn&#39;t in charge of one of its marquee programs.

Desperation cries from #ASU fans watching this basketball game might be my favorite thing about tonight.
Sure, Carson is going off, but two #ASU starters haven&#39;t scored on a combined 12 FGA. That&#39;s not very good.
#ASU fan complains about how bad Bachynski is defensively then gets mad at Carson for not taking a shot quick enough. High Expectations.
What a game for Carson, but #ASU needed 40 from him to squeak by a UNLV team that lost to Cal-Santa Barbara by 21 at home. Not a good sign.
Now ASU fan is amazed that 13 NBA scouts were at that game. This basketball thing must be like a brave new world.

Something worth watching today: B.J. Denker&#39;s grip on the football. Not very big hands + rain = bad combo.
Arizona has played three games in downpours this year...that&#39;s gotta be rare.
Ka&#39;Deem Carey, meet America. America, Ka&#39;Deem.
Looks like RT Mickey Baucus shaken up on the TD. Trainers looking at him.
Wow, BJ Denker. I didn&#39;t think he had any of these throws in him.
That Mariota lateral was thrown at the Oregon 49 and caught at the 50...would have been overturned if reviewed.  #ArizonaWildcats
Taylor Denker with the pooch kick out of Todd Graham&#39;s playbook.
Oregon is starting to get real chippy...#ArizonaWildcats need to handle that well in a close game.

How does Oregon get away with a false start on like 95 percent of its offensive plays?
The #ArizonaWildcats are going to win this game and it&#39;s absolutely unbelievable.
BJ Denker: 19/21 for 177 yards and two touchdowns. Good way to beat a top-5 team. #ArizonaWildcats
UA has a chance to win this game.
Every play here that Oregon doesn&#39;t score is a huge win for the #ArizonaWildcats
45,000 #ArizonaWildcats fans on the field right now couldn&#39;t change the outcome. This one&#39;s over. Wow.
In terms of this game&#39;s location in the &quot;rebuilding process&quot;, it feels like Derrick Williams just dunked on Duke.
Oregon has had like 3 or 4 of the most blatant holds I&#39;ve ever seen and somehow that last one didn&#39;t get called.
Oregon is just getting physically abused right now and it&#39;s awesome.
&quot;What a performance by Arizona State&#39;s D.&quot; Well, we knew that was coming eventually.
I was feeling good about Ohio State -33.5 when the Buckeyes were up 42-0. Not so much right now.
I wonder what the clown I sat in front of during the UCLA game who was bashing the 3-3-5 for three straight hours has to say right now.
Good god UCLA act like you&#39;ve at least practiced a late game situation before.

Hey, three incompletions by Palmer and all three should have been picked off.
What a clown...you&#39;re losing 24-3, haven&#39;t gotten a stop, and you do that when you get a sack?
The Cardinals need to take the playcalling from that drive and bury it in a place it will never be found again.
I feel like four-way stop signs and turn signal usage are pretty solid measures of intelligence.
@ebradz @ericbbrady Nahhhh
The best part about the picture of the two Florida guys blocking each other is the Georgia Southern guy face-down at the goal line.

Internet #ASU fan says JR Redmond and Marion Grice are better than Ka&#39;Deem. That&#39;s beautiful.
Ohio State is a 17-point road favorite against Michigan. For history&#39;s sake, OSU opened -17 at home against a BAD 2010 UM team.
I think the AP had a high school sophomore who&#39;s never shot basketball before shoot the ASU hoops game tonight.
Win or lose tonight, this tourney couldn&#39;t have gone better for #ArizonaWildcats. Huge deficit against Drexel plus weird wait-time tonight.
You want young, possibly championship-caliber teams to deal with as much weird stuff as possible early in the season.#ArizonaWildcats have.
Tarczewski watch: One touch, one turnover.
#ArizonaWildcats are doing exactly nothing well right now.
I&#39;m glad there&#39;s only one sport where refs can influence the game at any point they feel like it. God this is frustrating.

Ohio State is getting punked by the worst offense in America
Now Dontre Wilson is gone. Fan fucking tastic, Ohio State.
But the refs let it get there. You HAVE to stop it when five UM guys surround Wilson when he&#39;s trying to get up.
That is absolutely, 100 percent on the refs. Terrible officiating.
The good news is that Michigan will be out of gimmicks soon.
I get the heat-of-the-moment argument to an extent, but what seriously provokes someone to want to throw a punch in a football game? Really.
How do you stop brawls? Flag UM for talking shit after every tackle. But maybe too little too late.
It&#39;s going to be the most ACC thing ever when Duke beats Florida State next weekend.
Love that decision by Hoke, but can&#39;t believe he&#39;d do that without a better play lined up.

#AZCardinals didn&#39;t play well but they were robbed of a chance to win this game by the officiating.

There were no fouls in the first half and about 50 in the second half, so I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s Pac-12 refs on the KU-Colorado game.

Yeah, that last shot&#39;s a pretty good synopsis of the first half. Not sure that could have gone much worse for UA and it&#39;s still in it.
Do they really let the other team set up offense when a guy is down? Thought they stop it unless it&#39;s a fast break.
Do they really let the other team set up offense when a guy is down? Thought they stop it unless it&#39;s a fast break.
Also worth pointing out that that&#39;s a four-point swing in a close game on the road. Those aren&#39;t good.
One of the refs in this game worked Iowa-Iowa State last night, which ended at 11:30 p.m. Because that makes sense, right?
Lol at no And-1 on that Tarczewski dunk after some of the ticky-tack crap that&#39;s been called at the other end.
So no we&#39;re at at least two free points and a free possession for Michigan thanks to horrible calls.
Not that I&#39;m saying the refs are any worse in this game than they typically are, because they&#39;re not. But it&#39;s still an issue.
At least Arizona seems to be learning that if you initiate contact offensively you&#39;re probably getting a call.
&quot;You can&#39;t win a game like this if you don&#39;t play it.&quot; Classic SMiller.

I&#39;ll take the blame for that one. RT @Vincemarotta: So much for a fast-moving first half.
After reading the fantastic MMQB story on an officiating crew, I&#39;m curious what this review&#39;s going to be like.
Just a general though: How is a hit in the endzone in a 3-point game in Week 15 of a team in a playoff race unnecessary roughness?
I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a more difficult feat in sports than winning on the road in the NFL.
Things playoff teams don&#39;t do: Blow 17-point leads in less than three minutes.
Cards have been stupid, but they have 3x as many penalties as the Titans for 4x as many yards.
How in God&#39;s green earth is that not a 15-yard personal foul at the end of the play? That&#39;s terrible.
Seriously, Powers got lit up in the end zone without the ball. That&#39;s a joke.

Sometimes things just aren&#39;t meant to be...like the Cardinals making the playoffs this year.
Lesson learned: Don&#39;t hit Rob Housler in the face because he won&#39;t catch it.
Wilson throws late, over the middle, across his body and it&#39;s incomplete. Palmer hits his TE in the face in the endzone and it&#39;s an INT.
Patrick Peterson is a bad decision machine lately
The Cardinals must have really pissed off whoever is in charge of luck this season.
Seahawk fans are so great that they&#39;re booing their team that&#39;ll be the No. 1 seed and has won 14 straight at home.

Not that I have any bias against kickers from years of torment, but I don&#39;t think many people realize how devastating a missed short FG is.
Powers is getting destroyed but it&#39;s not his fault it&#39;s a physical mismatch. He&#39;s been in position on almost all of Boldin&#39;s catches.
Didn&#39;t Palmer learn his lesson about throwing to Housler in the end zone last week?
49ers guy rips off Ellington&#39;s shoe and sock, drops it, kicks it, and no penalty?
I&#39;m legitimately surprised Housler didn&#39;t get up and drop the ball after that catch.
Remember when Boldin had 6 catches for 106 yards in the first quarter? One catch for 8 yards since then.
That&#39;s not going to stand.
I take that back. Thought his elbow came down OOB before the second foot but I&#39;m wrong.
By the Numbers: The #AZCardinals&#39; 23-20 loss to the San Francisco #49ers -http://bit.ly/1eP38ZH&nbsp;
#AZCardinals NT Dan Williams: &quot;We gave them a lot ... in the end, it came back and bit us.&quot; -http://bit.ly/1jYj1iR&nbsp;
#AZCardinals QB Palmer becomes first in NFL history to reach 4,000 yards with three different teams -http://bit.ly/1djgpq7&nbsp;
That&#39;s only 20 INT less than Carson Palmer. MT @ZachEClark: Nick Foles ... 27 TD, 2 INT and now a NFC East championship. #Incredible
Lolwut? MT @FitzBeatSr: AZ qualifies for the playoffs! Nick Coles QB incredible year for Eagles No.1 QB based on QBR- http://bit.ly/1geXtti&nbsp;
Texas Tech clearly watched film of BJ Denker and is trying to emulate the #ArizonaWildcats offense against ASU.
ASU couldn&#39;t be getting any luckier and is still getting ran. That&#39;s a shocker.
Valiant effort by Will Sutton trying to get himself into the box score.
And LOL at fans on either side acting like bowl games mean anything about a team or coaching staff.
Arizona&#39;s special teams are extra special today.
Arizona&#39;s special teams are extra special today.
After seeing Williams, what would Ka&#39;Deem run for in the ACC? 3,000 yards? 4,000? Totally unimpressed.
Good for BJ Denker going out with a game like this.
Unfortunately for ESPN announcer&#39;s gambling reference, Arizona was -7, not -24. At least have a clue if you&#39;re gonna go there.
First New Years Eve, first time on Mill Ave. Pray for me, y&#39;all.

Last-second pick to beat Duke 52-48...must be time for the SEC chant.
You are Wisconsin. It&#39;s third and inches in field goal range and your backup quarterback is in the game. What do you do?
In what world is 80 yards on 13 carries &quot;bottled up?&quot;
The idea that the #ArizonaWildcats went head-to-head with Bama in something to do with football and won is mind boggling.
About 30 minutes to tip between #ASU and Washington. Might be more band members than fans here.pic.twitter.com/65oYhvxNFu
I think this is the first non-UA ASU hoops game I’ve been to. What an odd environment.
McKissic hits a 3 to put #ASU up 14-8. Pimps it down the court. Blackwell gets a dunk for UW with no one within 10 feet.
#ASU up 16-12 at the under-16 timeout. McKissic has 7, Carson has 5. Only 3 points for Devils haven’t been in paint or at FT line.
Washington’s 8-0 run puts the Huskies up 18-16 at the 11:59 mark. UW getting a lot of easy baskets. Doesn’t look good when it can’t run.
Now that UW run is extended to 18-4. Huskies lead #ASU 30-20 with 6:46 left in the first.
#ASU trails Washington 40-23 at half. Carson has 10. Bachynski 4 and 4. UW ended the half on a 28-7 run.
There are a few ways to be down 17 at halftime to a bad team. Shooting 29 percent is one. Allowing 52 percent another. #ASU trying both.
Looking big picture, #ASU has to win games like this if it wants a tournament look. Especially when its one of few national TV games.
#ASU shot 10 percent over the last 12 minutes or so of the half.
The sound people here somehow missed the memo that there are about 6,000 people here.
#ASU went zone to close the first half. Now going full-court to open the second. Devils still down 15.
#ASU’s 9-0 run gets the Washington lead to 10. Timeout Huskies. Sun Devils shooting 66 percent in the 2nd after closing the 1st 2-of-20.
That didn’t last long. UW’s 8-0 run gets the lead back up to 18. Not 6 minutes into the second half and we’ve had a 9-0 and 8-0 run.
#ASU’s bench finally gets on the board…at the 11:46 mark of the second half. Washington leads 56-41 with 11:22 to play.
Nigel Williams-Goss comes up with a steal and layup and UW (8-5) leads by 23 with 7:57 to go. Shaping up to be a bad loss for #ASU.
Weirdest part about this game is UW isn’t playing out of its mind or anything. Neither team looks like anything special.
This one’s all but over. Washington leads #ASU 74-52 with 3:41 to go. Brutal loss for the Sun Devils.
So of course I spend 10 minutes trying to find blowout home losses for #ASU then it decides it wants to make this look like a close game.
Final from Wells Fargo Arena: Washington 76, #ASU 65. Sun Devils’ first home loss of the season and it wasn’t as close as the score.
Sendek calls #ASU’s shot selection the worst of the season. “Obviously we just didn’t play very well.&quot;
FAT GUY TOUCHDOWN THIS IS AWESOME
