Grant Shapps want to cut off money to an organisation that had held him to account multiple times. I see.

Lovely work from @easyJet. Arrive on time for flight. Told they&#39;ve sold my seat. Can&#39;t travel until tomorrow now. What the hell?
@easyJet you&#39;re not following me...
@easyJet I can&#39;t DM - you&#39;re not following me!
Went with easyjet to save our budget. Looks like it will now cost £100s more thanks to them overbooking.
Irony of tweeting this while sat under their ad that says &quot;we love business customers!&quot; is also highly enjoyable.
@dangillmor happens all too often. In gaming too - FIFA 14 £40 in the shops,£60 as a download!
I&#39;ve squeezed on a diff @easyjet flight, so Berlin is *go*. Unless it&#39;s too windy.
Only bonus from @easyjet fiasco... bumped into Last.fm founder Martin Skitsel! Also on his way to Disrupt.

@IndelibleFudge @dansumption heard a bloke wind up his missus about there once. &quot;Why&#39;s it called Guy&#39;s hospital?!&quot; &quot;they treat the men 1st!&quot;
Feeling rather uninspired by #tcdisrupt. A lot of people functioning on hot air and little else
It&#39;s easy to be the cynical journo, of course, and I admire the energy. But too many firms&#39; strategy = Kickstarter, yay!
When they don&#39;t get the funding they&#39;ll blame it on a lack of coverage, rather than a cack idea #tcdisrupt
Also - no noticeable vetting of exhibitors here. Besides terrible, I&#39;ve seen one start-up that is downright dangerous #tcdisrupt
Thankfully I bumped into a similarly fed-up journo here in the shape of @benjrooney. #tcdisrupt is exhausting, for all the wrong reasons.
@Dan_Martin Kickstarter has lowered the entry bar. It means terrible ideas don&#39;t require any support to feel like they&#39;ve &#39;started&#39;
@Dan_Martin Before Kickstarter, you&#39;d need some money. Either your own, or an investors. It&#39;s a good filter of bad ideas.
@Dan_Martin @benjrooney I have been impressed by a couple of companies, yes. Published here:http://bbc.in/1gXQmJk&nbsp;

@WillardFoxton eh? It&#39;s nothing like Buzzfeed at all...
@WillardFoxton it&#39;s about the delivery method - going directly into tweets rather than expecting people to come to us
@WillardFoxton if reaching a bigger audience that wouldn&#39;t normally find us is the &quot;worst&quot; idea, I&#39;m an astronaut.
@WillardFoxton we use twitter, aye, but we don&#39;t *broadcast* on it - as in, everything at the mo requires people to visit our site
@cgalbraith very much a flying visit, so others will know better - but start at Burgermeister and work from there!

Fella lets out little fart as he strained to lift a suitcase. Daughters horrified. &quot;Trick or treat!&quot; he says. Magic.
Followed by him gesturing at me saying &quot;well he found it funny&quot;. Yes sir, yes sir I did.
Sadly searches for tweets with &quot;dad farted&quot; in the text has yielded no leads.

@Liberationtech I did, actually - but the ethics question is about hindering revenues, not tracking. I&#39;ve purposefully not made the link
@Liberationtech Internet ads *can* be a form of surveillance, but not always. As I said, my piece was about a diff debate.

@brokenbottleboy I was surprised as to the extent of the allegations against R Kelly - the point of the piece isn&#39;t that they&#39;re new
@brokenbottleboy But that very little has happened as a result. That was Caitlin&#39;s surprise (and mine too....)
@MrPassingham E! had to apologise in court... will Google?
@MandaMindie Email is in my bio. Cheers!
@MandaMindie Haha, don&#39;t worry. No-one noticed. Apart from EVERYONE
@marklittlenews Hi Mark - please get in touch, keen to talk to you for BBC News piece. Email in bio.
@nravitz Hi Natalie -- BBC News here. Can we use this pic?
@nravitz No prob! Cheers. What&#39;s the credit? &#39;NewsCorp&#39; ?
Might make a start on the Christmas shop. What&#39;s Oxford Street like today? (Besides windy as hell...)
@WillardFoxton quieter than Friday, then. Good good.
@MsSaraKelly Camden Market will be blown over any moment now, I&#39;m sure of it
@getbentsaggy Are you planning any Christmas tricks for your neighbour, Chris?
The weather is quite mesmerising really. Our block, on top of a hill in Greenwich, getting absolutely battered.
@ffgqc Hi Francis, have something to ask - what&#39;s best email for you?
Christmas break now truly in sight. Now playing this on repeat: http://bit.ly/19nofQI&nbsp; #beerbeerbeer
@chris_mandle racist
@dhrutishah @lucyburton @peter_page That... that has to be sarcasm
Do feel slightly sorry for the ISPs getting grief for blocking sites. None of them wanted blocking in the first place.
Then again, none had the bottle to oppose it on the record...
@GreenwichMean it&#39;s Christmas you miserable old sod! Stop tormenting me!
@maggieshiels merry Christmas :)
Merry Christmas to all - particularly friends working in the newsroom today and tonight.
Stick a fork in me
Seeing out the day with a bit of reading. First: &quot;Is Google Wrecking Our Memory?&quot; by Clive Thompsonhttp://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/09/are_search_engines_and_the_internet_hurting_human_memory.html&nbsp;…

&quot;He&#39;s got a funny name, hasn&#39;t he? Tor-ey yar-yar&quot; #footballnan
@DanCloughLT Ha, no. Might get me arrested.
Need @LewisWiltshire round here to explain to my mum that I can both watch TV and use my laptop at once. That&#39;s the point.

@markstencel What a treat - thanks for this. Love reading classics from the archives
Hi @FirstCC, what kind of service are you running out of Huntingdon tomorrow?
So smart - Oyster-like card in Singapore tells traffic lights to give elderly extra green man time http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/on_the_roads/traffic_management/green_man_plus.html&nbsp;…
@FirstCC but you&#39;re charging full peak prices...?
&quot;Are you charging full peak prices today?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;Are you running a full peak service?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;

Bravo.
@Phooto Too soon. I&#39;m hurting.
@WillardFoxton My thoughts exactly. Research like that adds very little to the debate
@chelleajohnson Ha! Sorry to disappoint. Try something else? I hear meth&#39;s quite lucrative.
@textfiles Hi Jason - Dave from BBC News in London here. Keen to chat about console archive. Can you drop me a line on dave.lee@bbc.co.uk?
@internetarchive Hi there - hoping to speak to someone asap for BBC story on console archive. I&#39;m on dave.lee@bbc.co.uk . Cheers!
@benjrooney By day&#39;s end you&#39;ll be both broke and broken.
The license fee covers a lot of things, but one thing&#39;s for sure, it doesn&#39;t quite stretch to heating at New Broadcasting House.
Might go outside to warm up a bit.
@ruskin147 during the Christmas break...? Rarer than the dodo... ;-)

@Cohen_Goes_HAM @christianhern @mikebutcher @jemimakiss RT rarely means an endorsement. Otherwise thousands of us endorsed Ed Balls.
&quot;If you&#39;re later than 8 there is a good chance you&#39;ll start the year with a lamb cutlet up your arse.&quot; .. should probably be on time tonight
@kenyanpundit lovely turn of phrase. I&#39;m stealing it for myself :)
@flashboy have you been reading my mum&#39;s texts?
So slow to this, but utterly addicted to Papers, Please. Why&#39;s it not on iOS?!
@ned_donovan Heh. Are you comparing the Apple App Store to a communist state?
@charlesarthur months ago sadly - maybe he&#39;s given up. Shame - such a smart title.
@charlesarthur @dukope feel bad now - people asking him about it constantly!
Happy new year all!
@chris_mandle I wanna plonka plonk with you Christoph Mand! 2014.

Housemate re-watching old Sherlocks in prep for tonight. Theme tune&#39;s got me all excited.
Odd goings on this morning. Not even 8am and I&#39;ve seen four blokes having a pint in the local, and one guy with a big Chinese takeaway.
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?!
Has to be... RT “@claireshiels: @davelee have we had the 3 min warning or something?!”
@WillardFoxton We had to already! Honestly, the morning rush can sometimes get violent.
Brilliant news everyone - Spaceballs has been added to Netflix!http://flip.it/WPyXR&nbsp;

Surprised @waltmossberg + co didn&#39;t launch Re/code with a blistering story to put it on the map straight away. Still, best of luck!
@JamesCridland Indeed -- but give it a day or two.
Genuinely fascinating AMA session on Reddit with a guy that has two penises. No, really: http://bit.ly/Kkj6O7&nbsp;
@skyboximaging Hi there, really keen to talk to you. Please get in touch - dave.lee@bbc.co.uk
Any shops doing good offers on luggage? Need something impressive to lug my pants around the world
Is it technically luggage if a suitcase is empty?
@hannah_goes Why not draw a comical double-willy on a post-it note...
@wonky_donky @hollybrocks If this kicks off a &quot;statues who think they&#39;re in music videos&quot; meme I&#39;ll be bloody delighted.
Annoying that CES allows all the companies to spam journalists en masse, but not the other way round. Would be far more productive!
i.e. I&#39;m trying to email as many fitness companies at the event at once. Proving time consuming
But this is where @charlesarthur pops up and says he&#39;s created a small robotic monkey to do it for him
@charlotteahenry aye!
@charlotteahenry Too late, Charlotte, too late.

@DavidClinchNews Yep!
@DavidClinchNews @marklittlenews A pint to toast your recent news, no less! Let&#39;s sort something out. Busy schedule, but can make it work
@tomwarren Very strange, isn&#39;t it? The point of that post is to have a go at the security firm, not apologise to users. Bad move, imo.
@tomwarren Growing pains, if I&#39;m being kind.
@mikebutcher Constantly. And so predictably I sometimes do it on purpose as a way of closing the thing.
To-do, Friday: 1) CES prep 2) CES prep 3) CES prep
4) Kick Bishop Brennan up the arse
Tempted to ask my dad - a tube driver on the Victoria line - to do a Reddit AMA. Would anyone care, do we think?
Or this?! Ha RT @willguyatt: @davelee I&#39;d read a texts from mum AMA.
@willguyatt Well quite - I&#39;d have to see about that
@willguyatt And I&#39;ve clearly just buggered up any chance of doing it anonymously. Dammit.

More BBC World Service programmes should be like #BBCOS. Far more relaxed and fun than traditional WS news shows.
@charlesarthur @ProfWoodward 2014&#39;s best social media strategy (for companies especially) is cheekiness. @O2 being another good example.
@charlesarthur @ProfWoodward Which is great, cos some poor soul will get it way off the mark and be wildly offensive/racist etc etc. #NEWS
