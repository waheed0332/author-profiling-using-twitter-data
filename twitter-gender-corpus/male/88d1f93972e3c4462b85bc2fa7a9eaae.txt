@Price_Points @vinnyverelli My good friend Craig made a good point. Jerkey is good, but can&#39;t be stuffed with apples and dried cherries.

The Subject Line read, “Success or Mediocrity?”  The terms are not mutually exclusive. I strive for excellence in mediocrity.
My speaker buddy @mikerayburn asks, &quot;What would it take for you to be the best?&quot; For me, an alternate universe.
@Price_Points I&#39;ve always strived for excellence in mediocrity. Dare to be above average.
@RonCulberson if they count the liquor I buy on board I&#39;d prefer dollars spent.
@EA How do you cancel an account? No way to contact you other than social media and I&#39;m not feeling very social. I want out.
@OriginInsider Get the questions you need? What a joke. I just want to cancel my account. Want to stop getting emails
@OriginInsider Should not have to jump through hoops to opt out or cancel an account. And no way to contact anyone.
@OriginInsider &quot;Contact Us&quot; what a joke. There is no way to actually contact you. Social media? I&#39;m feeling way too anti-social.

I say we choose either apples or oranges and get rid of the other one so we don&#39;t have to compare them anymore.
@thevanbrown I&#39;m somewhat goofy now. Wonder what I got into. Oh, now I remember .... what?
@Hyken or you could get rid of ALL social media and no one would know you were giving bad service.
@laurastack That&#39;s where my mirror is, under all those yellow notes.
