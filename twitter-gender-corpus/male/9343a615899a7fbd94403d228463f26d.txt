The latest newsletter from #LWF is at: http://bit.ly/lwfnews-250211 with @Abdulchohan @tonyvincent @rankinw #lwf11







Seton Hill: students see largest advantage of iPad as being access to resources #acuconnected

ACU: though undergrad campus is saturated with iPhones/iPods, budgets are tight. So how to get iPads in hands of fac/students? #acuconnected



ACU research: fac report signif class-related use of devices. What is significant? #acuconnected

ACU should focus on learning outside of classroom and how to connect it to classroom learning. Learning exp should be 24/7 #acuconnected






@GoldsAtWork the device doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s the access to content and tools that does #acuconnected



Why call an inkling textbook a &quot;textbook&quot;? It&#39;s so much more than text or book! #acuconnected #Matt McInnis

Jekyll &amp; Hyde AR book on YouTube http://m.youtube.com/#/results?q=jekyll%20and%20hyde%20ar%20book #acuconnected #AR



ACU Student: iPad didn&#39;t make much of a difference because pedagogy didn&#39;t change. Teachers should harness its potential #acuconnected.


@derekbruff: &quot;Mobile learning *in* the classroom&quot;: sounds like an oxymoron to me.... #acuconnected

@derekbruff Right, but what do they do with them outside of class with those same devices that could enhance learning in the classroom?
@derekbruff: I got you. I agree that we should focus more on the integration of in and out of the classroom, not focus on one or the other







@ccoppolsen Good question. Netbooks don&#39;t seem to have gotten a lot of traction #acuconnected
Tatom: some of the FHU profs no longer use a textbook, but online resources. YES!! #acuconnected

FHU research: Students believe iPad encouraged engagement during lecture:. But why still lecture (new tech, old pedagogy) #acuconnected



Question remains: how can we get education to truly innovate fast enough and in ways that will scale? #acuconnected
AR stuff in the research track, always cool #acuconnected
AR at ACU http://kjar.posterous.com #acuconnected
However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the result - Churchill (importance of mobile research) #acuconnected

Seton Hill: students see largest advantage of iPad as being access to resources #acuconnected

ACU: though undergrad campus is saturated with iPhones/iPods, budgets are tight. So how to get iPads in hands of fac/students? #acuconnected



ACU research: fac report signif class-related use of devices. What is significant? #acuconnected

ACU should focus on learning outside of classroom and how to connect it to classroom learning. Learning exp should be 24/7 #acuconnected






@GoldsAtWork the device doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s the access to content and tools that does #acuconnected



Why call an inkling textbook a &quot;textbook&quot;? It&#39;s so much more than text or book! #acuconnected #Matt McInnis

Jekyll &amp; Hyde AR book on YouTube http://m.youtube.com/#/results?q=jekyll%20and%20hyde%20ar%20book #acuconnected #AR



ACU Student: iPad didn&#39;t make much of a difference because pedagogy didn&#39;t change. Teachers should harness its potential #acuconnected.


@derekbruff: &quot;Mobile learning *in* the classroom&quot;: sounds like an oxymoron to me.... #acuconnected

@derekbruff Right, but what do they do with them outside of class with those same devices that could enhance learning in the classroom?
@derekbruff: I got you. I agree that we should focus more on the integration of in and out of the classroom, not focus on one or the other







@ccoppolsen Good question. Netbooks don&#39;t seem to have gotten a lot of traction #acuconnected
Tatom: some of the FHU profs no longer use a textbook, but online resources. YES!! #acuconnected

FHU research: Students believe iPad encouraged engagement during lecture:. But why still lecture (new tech, old pedagogy) #acuconnected



Question remains: how can we get education to truly innovate fast enough and in ways that will scale? #acuconnected
AR stuff in the research track, always cool #acuconnected
AR at ACU http://kjar.posterous.com #acuconnected
However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the result - Churchill (importance of mobile research) #acuconnected
