Were moving!
Finally moving http://instagram.com/p/hrVy2aiUve/&nbsp;
@jsvtraffic The turnpike is a mess but finally moving. Probably going to take crews all night to get the ice that has accumulated.
@NBCPhiladelphia I have a video of me stuck in traffic. Check my Instagram feed.
So some of my Instagram pictures may end up on the ABC and CBS news tonight.   That should nudge my @Klout score.  Heh.
Apparently my video is on cnn.  I should have combed my hair. http://instagram.com/p/hrZp61CUmq/&nbsp;
Just passed the accident. They are still another 20 or 30 cars that need to be coat away.
After 6 1/2 hours, I am home.  Just missed my video being on @ABC  national news.   Heh.  Does that bounce my @klout score up?
@VictorFiorillo I wasn&#39;t very happy to be stuck 5 hours in the traffics stoppage.  Although I did have fun tweeting all day.
@ThisIsLeadFeed @AdedolapoI @WF_muller @cavinhandoko @journalist_OL @juanmuriango @NewsThisSecond @Feeds4U @sipsoul  That&#39;a my video. Heh.
@WorldNews24_7 @sp4zee @Deonguillory @mars_adonis @anto_kece2 @phlexi @FidaSyahadah That&#39;a my video. Heh.
But no one used @beejer   Tag.  Heh.  Whomp Whomp.
@jsvtraffic Yea they did.  People were ordering pizza and getting to delivered where bridges crossed the driveway.
My video is shown at the 1:30 mark.   Wintery Weather Causes Pileups on US Highwayshttp://abcn.ws/1fbaDXF&nbsp;
@CoconnellFox29 Look good on TV. I was stuck on the turnpike all day today.  Heh.
@CoconnellFox29 same here.  A national news broadcast used one of my Instagram videos. Heh.
@CoconnellFox29 I know right?  Heh. But they didn&#39;t put my twitter handle on it.  What kind of dog and pony show do they have over at @ABC?
@JohnBolaris @jbolaris @phillydotcom good read.
@katiefehlinger So what&#39;s the deal for tomorrow?  What time will I be slipping and sliding on crutches?  Heh.
@JohnBolaris So what time will I be slipping and sliding tomorrow between Reading and King of Prussia.  Heh.
@GMA @ABC If you are going to use my video from the PA Turnpike, please credit my twitter handle.   #needthosefollowers
I say good sir... lets us have a bit of culture today while we hawk our wears on the interwebs.  Here, Here!http://spoti.fi/1cw3Wz8&nbsp;
@KloutSupport If I connect my Google+ to Klout, but don&#39;t use it that often, will that pull down a score?
@shopkeepz @TheRevBobLevy I thought they smelled bad on the outside.
Enjoyed my performance with @vegaslancaster  &amp; @MatthewDLamson at @BenLikesRetro show on Saturday.  Now back into hibernation until healed.
@JohnBolaris I hope you have a screener.

@Air_ikahh Olf.  I got stuck on the Turnpike 2 weeks ago.   #protip order pizza and have them deliver it to an overpass bridge.
@jsvtraffic Olf.  Glad I didn&#39;t get stuck there.... AGAIN.    When do you think they&#39;ll have it cleaned up?
@Air_ikahh @PennaTurnpike I made an instagram video that eventually got used on @ABC new that night. There&#39;s always that. Also.. Candy Crush

@jsvtraffic Well I&#39;m not leaving Malvern until 5pm.  Surely it&#39;ll be better by then,.
@jsvtraffic hmmm.... this might be a route 401 night.  Hope the backroads are salted/melted by then.
@jsvtraffic Cool.  Heh.  Each of your tweets back to me is showing up my @pebble watch.  #dicktracy
@jsvtraffic @erikashych Olf.  I feel ya.  I was stuck on there a few weeks ago for 5 hours.
@jsvtraffic Two 5+ hours closure of the PA turnpike going west bound int he same general area does not reflect well on PENNDOT.
@jsvtraffic Snow squalls shouldn&#39;t cause a completely disruption of the highway system.  (Including I-78)
@jsvtraffic There is no westbound highway access for the past 5+ hours other then Rt 30 (blah) and 422 (ends in Reading).
@jsvtraffic Wait!!!!  Isn&#39;t this how Red Dawn started?   #Wolverines #Paturnpike
@jsvtraffic ha.   #nailedit
@jsvtraffic Welp.  401 for me.  @CBSPhilly  says turnpike to be closed for another 2 to 3 hours.
@jsvtraffic @CBSPhilly Probably less ice to remove then the major accident 2 weeks ago.  Still... I ain&#39;t taking the Turnpike back.
@drew More like... D&#39;ohlwallet.   #seewhatIdidthere
@jsvtraffic Any word with the turnpike being closed what secondary routes are going to become congested? I&#39;m going to guess, 322, 23, 401,30
@jsvtraffic Nice job ;)
@jsvtraffic Heh.  The Route 100 is the bookends for today&#39;s awfulness.
