@JakeTapper since you interviewed the Colemans about the Maryville rape case, I thought this might interest you: http://themissouritorch.com/2013/11/06/inconsistencies-questions-outright-lies-daisy-coleman-case/&nbsp;…
@caulkthewagon Sorry you feel that way. I thought saying the post didn&#39;t claim Daisy lied, twice, showed I wasn&#39;t being a rape apologist.
@caulkthewagon I RTed your personal attack. I&#39;m not a rape apologist.
@caulkthewagon Did I claim Daisy was lying?  Please show me where I did that.
@caulkthewagon &quot;While they don’t disprove Daisy’s story and it’s possible what she claims is the truth, these cracks need to be discussed...
@caulkthewagon &quot;Also, this article doesn’t disprove that Daisy was raped.  It’s possible that her version is exactly what happened.&quot;
@caulkthewagon I disagree. There are some serious problems in the story. Pointing them out does not equal being a rape apologist..
@caulkthewagon @PeaceintheVille This is part of the problem. You dare step outside the accepted narrative, and you get smeared. Pitiful.
@caulkthewagon Right. I shouldn&#39;t focus on the inconsistencies. Ok. Tell me more about your definition of &quot;journalism.&quot;
@caulkthewagon @PeaceintheVille No, you&#39;re not. You&#39;re being reactionary and close minded.
@caulkthewagon I&#39;m not trying to disprove her hair was frozen. I just asked how it got wet. No one ever mentions wet hair.
@YourAnonCentral @caulkthewagon It&#39;s also important to know exactly what they confessed to.
@caulkthewagon Did you read the article?
@caulkthewagon Of course it does.
@caulkthewagon What are your thoughts about the lies told about me?
@caulkthewagon That wasn&#39;t a pity party. I point out someone&#39;s lies and I&#39;m a rape apologist. Makes sense. I&#39;m done with you. Bye.
@caulkthewagon No, it&#39;s because there&#39;s nothing I could show or tell you to change your opinion.
@CourtneyPFB What did the boys admit to, exactly?
@CourtneyPFB &quot;Barnett...insisted the sex was consensual.&quot;
@CourtneyPFB No, that&#39;s not enough said. Sorry, but the whole story matters. @PeaceintheVille @caulkthewagon
@CourtneyPFB @PeaceintheVille @caulkthewagon http://www.kansascity.com/2013/10/12/4549775/nightmare-in-maryville-teens-sexual.html&nbsp;…
@caulkthewagon And it&#39;s sad that you take one story that clearly omits facts and treat it as the gospel truth.
@caulkthewagon I&#39;ll see if I can get something published in the Kansas City Star, then maybe you&#39;ll believe it. Probably not, though.
@caulkthewagon http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111030103235AAzODtX&nbsp;…
@caulkthewagon Probably not good enough for you, but there is a difference.
@caulkthewagon I find it hilarious you demand so much from me, and so little from every other journalist.
@PeaceintheVille According to multiple accounts, her hair was frozen. @caulkthewagon @CourtneyPFB
@caulkthewagon Attacking the source is a logical fallacy.  Logic. Try it.
@caulkthewagon What authority on the difference between yoga pants and sweats do you respect most? I&#39;ll consult them.

@anthropocon That&#39;s cool, but I was expecting a chupacabra pelt.
@anthropocon It&#39;s like I don&#39;t even know you.
@anthropocon I know they hide.  Everyone knows they hide. It&#39;s why hardly anyone sees them. Duh.
@e2pilot @anthropocon I have data that shows chupacabra actually generate a low level frequency that Nokia phones can pick up.
@e2pilot @anthropocon Chupacabra might come from Latvia. I learned that on Ask Jeeves. @FingersMalloy
Well, now you&#39;ve gone too far.  @anthropocon @e2pilot @FingersMalloy
Now if I can just find a way to inject Bill Brasky into this... @e2pilot @anthropocon @FingersMalloy
Bill Brasky once killed a chupacabra with a Nokia phone and wore its hide. @e2pilot @anthropocon @FingersMalloy
And that looks EPIC! RT @BenHowe: How did I miss this Doctor Who trailer? HOW DID I MISS IT?http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Mkq8pnvsnQg&nbsp;…
I think Bill Brasky ate the chupacabra, used its hide as a cover for his Nokia, then ate his Nokia. @e2pilot @anthropocon @FingersMalloy
Then used his lower tract to call for a pizza. BILL BRASKY! @e2pilot @anthropocon @FingersMalloy
Great minds. @anthropocon @e2pilot @FingersMalloy
@BenHowe I just called my son in to watch it with me, then order him to go watch all the episodes on Netflix. He needs to catch up.
@BenHowe And I would like to note that @WithJohnHurt&#39;s moustache is pretty awesome. It&#39;s Sam Elliott caliber.

Irony: @dubhe0ne attacks @SooperMexican for being anonymous while he&#39;s a self-proclaimed member of #Anonymous.
@dubhe0ne I guess that&#39;s a good place to start.  Why do you hate gays and Jews? @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne You seriously didn&#39;t pull the &quot;I have gay friends&quot; line, did you? @SooperMexican @GayPatriot
@dubhe0ne So, since @GayPatriot is my friend, you&#39;re saying I can use any homophobic line I want and it&#39;s all good? @SooperMexican
Hypocrite: Nixon Vetoes Tax Cut for All, Calls Special Session for Tax Breaks for Boeing | The Missouri Torch http://ow.ly/rnazC&nbsp;
@dubhe0ne Didn&#39;t you use the word &quot;puñal?&quot; @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
&quot;the terms used in this specific case — made up of the words maricones and puñal — were offensive.&quot; @dubhe0ne @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne Linky goodness: http://news.yahoo.com/gay-slurs-arent-protected-speech-mexico-232149370.html&nbsp;… @GayPatriot @SooperMexican Mexican government says you used an offensive slur.
@dubhe0ne Tell the Mexican government to research Japanese Spanish slang. They said its offensive. @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne Look, you clearly used an offensive slur against gay people. Just admit it. And your dislike of Jews. @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne That&#39;s weak. Going after the author instead of addressing your use of offensive gay slurs. @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne It was the Mexican Supreme Court that said puñal was offensive. Do they know about your heritage? @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne So you tell @SooperMexican to perform oral sex on a man, then ask him for civil discourse? Seriously? @GayPatriot
@dubhe0ne My endgame is to get you to apologize for your offensive slurs. @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne If you love Jews, why does your Twitter info say Zionism will destroy the Earth? @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne Admit it. You&#39;re not Mexican. You&#39;re Alec Baldwin. Just come clean about it. @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne &quot;Prove I dislike gays. Just don&#39;t show the offensive slurs I used as evidence of my hate.&quot; #MakesSense @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@GayPatriot You&#39;re welcome. @dubhe0ne
@dubhe0ne I don&#39;t speak Spanish, or hate agains gays. Seems you speak both. @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
*Your FTFY RT @dubhe0ne: HAHAHAHAH you&#39;re idiocy is relentless @Bodhi1 @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne Maybe if you wrote &quot;your&quot; in Spanish, you&#39;d have gotten that right. Also, you hate gay people. @GayPatriot @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne Just admit you used an offensive homophobic slur and say you&#39;re sorry.
@dubhe0ne Maybe he wants his anonymity? As a member of #Anonymous, you should respect that, not condemn it. You&#39;re a hypocrite.
@dubhe0ne The fact is, the Mexican Supreme Court would convict you for your comments as disparaging to homosexuals. You knew what you meant.
His words -&gt; RT @dubhe0ne: .@Bodhi1 FUCK #Anonymous. My name is Lenin, I&#39;m in LA. to be more specific...here you go 34.0482° N, 118.2530° W
@dubhe0ne What? Doesn&#39;t the Mexican Supreme Court know your heritage?
@Bodhi1 @YourAnonCentral If we could only find Matt that easily !
@dubhe0ne You&#39;re an American using Spanish words the Mexican Supreme Court says are offensive, but you&#39;re not using offensive slang. #Right
You&#39;re thinking of Highlander. @_MGrey_ @dubhe0ne @SooperMexican
@dubhe0ne Not what I said, you liar. I said you were clearly using derogatory homophobic slang, and you were. It&#39;s very simple.
@KristinaRibali Meanwhile, 75 people were able to use http://ApologizeClaire.com&nbsp; to ask @clairecmc for an apology for Obamacare.
@dubhe0ne Again, not what I said. You used a derogatory slang for homosexuals. Not my claim, but the Mexican Supreme Court. Just admit it.
#FTFY RT @KatiePavlich: Terrific. Now Carney is blaming Republicans. This is Monday.
@dubhe0ne You can try and use the appeal to ridicule fallacy, but the fact remains, you used homophobic terms to attack @SooperMexican.
@dubhe0ne But I thought you said you were American?
@dubhe0ne I&#39;ve been talking about the Mexican Supreme Courts ruling that you&#39;re a hateful homophobic bigot.
@dubhe0ne But you said earlier you were American. Now you say you&#39;re Mexican. You seem confused.
I&#39;d just like to say that from day one, http://ApologizeClaire.com&nbsp; works better than http://Healthcare.gov&nbsp;, and I built it for nothing.
@KBatthelake Never said I was in favor of gay marriage, but it&#39;s good to see you&#39;re keeping your streak of telling lies going.
@KBatthelake You make a lot of assumptions and base your statements on them. Then pat yourself on the back for your brilliance.

@tonymess From your link: &quot;It&#39;s still unknown how many of the enrollees were previously uninsured...&quot; - Looks like 6 million more is bogus.
@tonymess That whole article is based on speculation, e.g. &quot;it&#39;s unclear how many have enrolled yet.&quot; How can you seriously cite it?
@tonymess Can you tell me the opportunity cost of the 5 million who lost their insurance? They&#39;ll pay more.  What do they give up?

@Torcho I see.  Just asking questions is enough to shut you down? Must be weak ground you&#39;re standing on.
@papacass84 So did I.  I was driving heavy equipment for my dad when I was 14-15.
@papacass84 That&#39;s physical labor. Clearly you grew up in a third world country, right?
HA! RT @papacass84: @Bodhi1 yes. Toledo Ohio.
@Torcho So you&#39;re not going to explain why a 13 y/o shouldn&#39;t be allowed to bag groceries?
I curious. Which do you think is a bigger contributor to gun crime: access to guns or the fatherless families? @tonymess @YaelTAbouhalkah
Various models, and sizes, for your specific needs. RT @ShaneWright22: @AmeliaHammy I hear @Bodhi1 started renting his out.
