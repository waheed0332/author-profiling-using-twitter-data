The #startuptour bus on Portobello Road was pretty good!pic.twitter.com/N0RB8qh78j
@bleepcomms @startupbritain really? 3 events seems pretty good to me. Scotland has only one.
@emmaljones nice to meet you on the #startuptour bus today. See you on Monday!
Just discovered @LingQ_Central for language learning. Looks like it might be a good resource but the UI is not so great.
@bleepcomms @startupbritain P.S. I met them yesterday and they were very nice. Not muppets! They&#39;re not meant to be a Biz Link replacement.

@msamson87 @CallinMack easy to work unpaid when Mummy &amp; Daddy will support you. Not so easy if you&#39;re from an ordinary background!
@msamson87 @CallinMack and for that reason alone - to force some social mobility - unpaid internships should be banned imho.

I want to search Twitter for &quot;thisword&quot; but Twitter insists on returning results for &quot;this word&quot; which is irrelevant. Not possible?
@glennflanagan hello! I don&#39;t suppose you fancy beta-testing a Freeagent app I&#39;ve just built @satagonet?
@putt1ck I tried that, but I&#39;m still getting results for &quot;this word&quot;, when I search for &quot;&quot;thisword&quot;&quot;. :/
@glennflanagan no problem. Thanks for looking. It&#39;s meant for companies to anonymously share data about late-paying biz customers.
@davewardle hi Dave, I wonder if you would be interested in beta-testing a Freeagent app I built? @satagonet http://www.satago.co.uk&nbsp;
@brettpeekaboo Hi Brett, would you be interested in beta-testing a Freeagent app I built? @satagonet http://www.satago.co.uk&nbsp;
@glennflanagan no, because you only (anonymously) share data about companies, not individuals. It&#39;s all B2B data.
@davewardle ok. Thanks anyway! If you ever hear of anyone complaining about late-paying biz customers please point them towards @satagonet
@putt1ck aha! That one works. Thanks!
Decided to re-install Skype as it was running like a pig. Now get 1603 error. Punishment for declining Bing as my default search engine?
@myasmine belated congrats! You&#39;re one of those early people I remember twittering with back around 2009 when I was on another startup
I am now running a &quot;portable&quot; version of Skype, whatever that means. Slight irony in that my phone is probably more powerful than my laptop.
Given new Google Maps gives me a blank screen, I think I will return to classic Google Maps for now.

@yanroux I wish! I cycled everywhere in Berlin. 7 miles from where I live to town is bit too much or me. Also traffic kinda mad here.

@jeffseedrs @BillMorrow @AngelsDen yup, my @satagonet sure do add value. They range from mate&#39;s g/fs to super-successful entrepreneurs [1/2]
@jeffseedrs @BillMorrow @AngelsDen e.g. one of my investors is a great PR guy that I&#39;m about to start working with. super-connected.

@KcChano I think it went ok! :)
Nice coup for @AngelsDen to help @TheLuluLife get investment but I&#39;d advise entrepreneurs to also consider @Seedrs like I did 4 @satagonet
@TheLuluLife I don&#39;t know if your Angel round is closed yet, but with @Seedrs it probably would be by now. Took me 14days to raise £30k. :)
@anthonyngmonica @TheLuluLife and I spoke with @PixelPin tonight who also raised £150k on @Seedrs. How long did it take you Anthony?
@anthonyngmonica @TheLuluLife nice! I loved the excitement of seeing your investment total go up, £ by £, then *boom* someone invests £5k!
@anthonyngmonica we should meet up soon and swap notes. Also I want to suggest to @jeffseedrs that he starts a @Seedrs founders mailing list

@lylo @WendySLea like it or loathe it, the GS price change is going to make a great case-study. Discussion on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6090946&nbsp;
@lylo I feel your pain tho. For years I though having GS on my site would be cool. I finally get @satagonet started and price goes up 10x!
@lylo entry level prices increased from about $45/mo to the equivalent of something like $400/month (billed annually of course).
@mikebutcher ok, applied to pitch my new thang @satagonet

@Zee I lived there for a year until two weeks ago, but now I try to live there one week a month. Still got a flat etc. Now mostly in London.
@Zee not /too/ far out. Decent connections. Just up road (3km?) from Torstrasse where some decent bars etc.
@Zee but it would not be my first choice - is it AirBnB or something?
@Zee well honestly then my area. Quite quiet but loads of restaurants. Quite easy to get to the action. Gneisenaustrasse Ubahn
@Zee I know there are a few AirBnB places around there. Mittenwalderstrasse is my street.
@Zee lots of nice restaurants on Bergmanstrasse
Just bought some art from @BoydensKitchen. Nice!
@Zee no problem. Enjoy Berlin! I&#39;m going back myself on Tuesday for a week. Maybe some time you can write about my startup @satagonet
@f6s I have two applicants but I can&#39;t access them on your website. You having problems still?

Is @GetViable actually linked to @ericries &amp; @sgblank or are they just being quoted on the website? If the latter... kinda misleading.
@dmitrygusev I know. My computer is truly rubbish.
@ericries hmmm your photo is on the frontpage too along with @sgblank and @GuyKawasaki. @GetViable - you should probably change that.
Watching #makemeagerman and missing Berlin already. Certainly seems to be confirming life is better in Germany in pretty much all ways.
Didn&#39;t like the way #makemeagerman made out that Germany is worse off because there are less women at boardroom level.
@GetViable @ericries they do indeed have great thoughts to share, but your design makes it look like these guys are involved directly
@GetViable doesn&#39;t really make any difference to me now I know they&#39;re not, but @ericries et al might feel differently.

First experience of Windows 8 so far is that it is kinda annoying. Missing things for the sake of it?
@anthonyngmonica pretty sure I just paid for this privilege! ;)
@anthonyngmonica how does one do that? So far it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s worth the effort to get used to this. Windows 7 was quite decent.
Currently &quot;restoring&quot; my new laptop via @Dropbox. Only 6 days left at this rate. Might move nearer WiFi router...
Yeah not liking Windows 8 much. The worst so far is the Skype &quot;app&quot;. Hopefully I will get used to it and realise it is in fact brilliant...
Scotland football team in &quot;not completely rubbish&quot; shocker! #EngSco

I would suggest to Microsoft it is a UI #fail if I have to Google &quot;How to turn windows 8 computer off&quot;.
When you first run Chrome in Windows 8 it runs it in some really annoying &quot;app&quot; mode, and you have to force it to run normally again.
@andiih bah! Annoying. Need to access my wiki. btw have you seen I started @satagonet recently? http://www.satago.co.uk&nbsp; can u beta-test?

WiFi on the Oxford X90 is a nice idea in theory but it very seldom works, presumably because the bus itself has no 3G signal most the way.

@sniggy hi there! We should have coffee next time I am in Berlin. @anneriechert has told me about you.
@andrewrosemeyer @TexasJoes @dragonjones  if you got a £50k offer on @BBCDragonsDen I&#39;m sure you&#39;d get the same via @Seedrs. I raised £30k.
@TexasJoes It&#39;s crowd-equity investing. I raised £30k for 14% of my startup @satagonet. I have 60 investors with investments from £10 to £5k
Instead of HS2 could we not build @elonmusk&#39;s hyperloop between London and Scotland? Distance of Edinburgh-&gt;London = SanFran-&gt;LA.
If all of Scotland retweets my hyperloop tweet, I reckon @elonmusk will be on next plane to Scotland. We could fund it via @Seedrs!
@FrankSeedrs I have never been as excited to use an app as the first time I used @HailoLondon

Difficult to get from Stansted Airport to North London late at night w/o taxi. Worth subscribing to Zipcar or similar just for trip?
@DavidHOxford yeah the German versions of this are much better - you can just leave the car anywhere.
@sjwhitworth ha! I love you guys @HailoLondon but I&#39;m trying to save money here and a trip from Stansted ain&#39;t cheap.
With German car-sharing you leave the car wherever you want (parked). Seems in London with @ZipcarUK I have to return it to the *same spot*!
but maybe I&#39;m missing something. @ZipcarUK is the idea really that I leave the car where I collected it then I have to make my own way home?
@ZipcarUK it works well in Berlin. I&#39;ve used it quite a few times - can always find a car fairly close by and also drive home. @sjwhitworth
@HPSupport yeah also the screen is not great - there is a white mark in the middle. I&#39;m in the UK, only had it a few weeks. How do I return?
@HPSupport no I got it at @pcworld actually. I suppose I have to take it up with them?
@HPSupport but not this @pcworld - the one in the UK which appears not to have an obvious twitter account
@sjwhitworth I guess the size of London plus the draconian way parking laws are imposed make it impossible here. Am I right @ZipcarUK?
@HPSupport ok. Thanks for help.
@ZipcarUK Do I only pay for what time I actually use? Per 15min like in DE? Or do I have to book for Xmin and pay for that all regardless?
@ZipcarUK ok - well it looks like I&#39;ll be signing up later on then. Any referral bonus anyone (i.e. @sjwhitworth) can take advantage of?
What&#39;s best app to find places to work (i.e. coffee shops) with WiFi in London?
Surely @foursquare should have a filter for venues with WiFi?
@KLBarber ah yes I forgot about @WorkSnug. I wish it would open Map first. The AR is unnecessary IMO.
@KLBarber @WorkSnug in fact it won&#39;t open in map at all. Is it meant to do that?
@30StreetStudio installing. Thanks!
@curryspcworld I bought laptop from you in Dundee a couple of weeks ago, but battery life is v bad and screen has mark. What should I do?
@curryspcworld can you just exchange? I think I have some extra insurance/warranty from you - I need continual access to (a) laptop.
Simple way to help fix the UK North-South divide would be to do something about transport prices. Return train ticket London-Dundee = £222!!
@buro9 you read my mind for my next tweet. I don&#39;t need faster trains - I need reasonable travel costs and decent on-board WiFi.
@roomitchell ah it&#39;s the Edinburgh Centre for.... something at a very tight angle... What is it?
@psmith not good is it? Compare that to Germany where no city dominates so much. I wrote a blog post on the subject:http://bit.ly/HmrKol&nbsp;
@KLBarber no reply from @WorkSnug yet. Someone else recommended another app which I bought instead. Not tried it yet.
@ZipcarUK your referral email needs better call to action button and some UK localisation - the contact details are US @sjwhitworth

@WorkSnug @KLBarber Your UI is my problem. AR is ok, but I&#39;d like it to open in Map view 1st, then only AR when I hold it up.
@WorkSnug @KLBarber currently I open my phone as normal and see my feet and no info - I just want to see it all on a map.
@WorkSnug @KLBarber thanks but you have so much more info... than 5 shops in your app! Is your app meant to have a map mode?

My last email from Google @adwords has [MALICIOUS CONTENT] warning in Subject line and massive warnings at end of email (to Gmail!). Why?

@jackbremer I think Gmail would be ok, but I suspect you may be able to do this via @streak http://www.streak.com&nbsp;
@jackbremer hmm confusing tweet - I meant *GDocs* would be ok, but...
@DavidAirey nice to see you quoted in the BBC TSB article today.

@KennyEstesREI @randallb @Streak me asking too. I accidentally created two boxes for the same person. Would like to merge them. Possible?
@Streak what do you do when multiple emails have same Subject so are in same Gmail thread but should be in different Boxes? cc @cpinto
@adwords so what happens next?
Anyone using @streak know how to sort emails in to different Boxes when Gmail has grouped them in to one thread based on Subject line?
@cpinto how does one actually break the threads? It&#39;s vaguely annoying in Gmail, but those email chains are impossible to use with @streak
@cpinto that is quite a pain in the ass! I presume @streak are aware of this, but presume this is a Gmail limitation outwith their control
and so what is one meant to do when @streak just vamishes from your Gmail? #worrying
There&#39;s the answer. Wipe all cookies and cache and @streak comes back. I don&#39;t want to do that too often though!
&quot;Now, while we&#39;re all familiar with... - Drive to get &quot;Outwith&quot; in common use outwith Scotland | Facebook http://on.fb.me/15pKq4K&nbsp;

Lots of people kissing their phone today, thanks to Burberry. :*
@smcnulty73 you got a reply yet? I&#39;m still waiting. @Streak
@TimelyPA do u know how to use @streak when emails are grouped in same thread coz of same subject. Can&#39;t split emails to different boxes?

Would it be too much for Ryanair to make http://ryanair.com&nbsp; redirect to http://www.ryanair.com&nbsp;?
Twitter&#39;s URL shortening makes my last tweet look a tad confusing. Basically you need to add www to ryanair . com otherwise no website!
@brynmorgan it&#39;s mad! I could fix it! It must be soul-destroying to work on Ryanair&#39;s website!
Using Ryanair&#39;s website is a nightmare, but give them their due - I just booked two very cheap flights that I thought would be impossible.
also Ryanair credit card fees seem to have shrunk to nearly nothing.
I even used Ryanair&#39;s hotel booking website - but the £10 flight voucher I was promised never materialised...
Are Yahoo! not bothered that so many people using Chrome can&#39;t view any of their video content (me included)?

@KLBarber wow @RoyalMail website actually blocks me from viewing content as I&#39;m not in the UK just now! Even the International page!
.@RoyalMail why on earth do you block me from looking at your website? You realise people something work when abroad??
What I see when looking at the &quot;International&quot; page on the @RoyalMail website: http://i.imgur.com/lurQCxu.png&nbsp;
@RoyalMail can you tell me what page to look at if I want to setup UK logistics operations shipping high volume internationally?
@RoyalMail that&#39;s not massively helpful. :) Do you know the specific page? I can&#39;t find it.

@oflife how do you know why they are following you or retweeting you?
@fabianstelzer @eyequant thanks. You done any work with Rocket Internet?
@oflife retweeting, maybe, but it seems a tad harsh to block a legit company account for following you. I block obvious bots.
@oflife blocking someone from following you seems to not be in the spirit of Twitter. Should be reserved for harassment and similar imo
@oflife seems too close to censorship for my liking ;)
@oflife afaik you are not informed but it becomes obvious because you cannot follow them, I think your @replies to them are not sent too.
@oflife I presume you can still read tweets if you go directly to their profile.

Oh HMRC, why couldn&#39;t you make your complicated pdf forms &quot;fill-in-able&quot;? Now I have to use pen and paper. :/
So HMRC&#39;s SEIS pdf file is editable, but not the EIS one. That makes sense. EIS companies must prefer pen and paper.
For the first time ever the Gmail &quot;did you mean to attach something&quot; thingy just prevented me sending email without intended attachment.
@Streak any ETA on that? It makes Streak almost fundamentally unusable. Surely this is your most significant blocker beyond any features?
@Streak shortcut could be ability to add/edit emails associated with a Box.
@Streak perhaps you could write a Blog post about how to get round this problem till you fix it? i.e. Gmail best practices re Subjects etc
@Streak if I do follow ups after a conference I email 20 people w same subject line, they end up in one thread, and can&#39;t be used in Streak
@Streak now I&#39;m re-replying to all those 20 people and trying to edit each Subject name unique to break the thread to add to Streak :/

Holy crap @Ryanair is properly on Twitter now - and promising to start doing something called &quot;Customer Service&quot;.
Hey @Ryanair the only reason I actively avoid flying with you is that your hand-luggage size is slightly smaller than everyone else [1/2]
[2/2]@Ryanair which means if you have any flights booked on other airlines it&#39;s only Ryanair that forces you to use small luggage whole trip
@Ryanair a cynic would say your hand luggage size limit is slightly smaller to force unexpected hold fees and Ryanair/Samsonite purchases

@henry_mance Hi Henry, I&#39;m at #WebSummit - would you like to meet to discuss @satagonet? Launched this week - in Alpha Pitch track here.
@jennalee Hi Jennifer, I&#39;m at #WebSummit - would you like to meet to discuss @satagonet? Launched this week - in Alpha Pitch track here.

@leemallon thanks! sure - let&#39;s talk next week.
@sparky000 Hi, I&#39;m meant to be talking to you now but I don&#39;t have your phone number. Could you send it to me via DM? cc: @martincampbell
Am I using international roaming when in Ireland? I didn&#39;t get a roaming text from @O2
@O2 Republic, but I&#39;m leaving now. I know the North is in the UK - I&#39;m no that daft! ;)
Leaving Dublin now. #WebSummit was very impressive. Great for @satagonet. Have to say - Ireland really has its sh*t together.
I especially liked the interaction between @elonmusk and the Taoiseach. I bet @TeslaMotors ends up building a plant in Ireland.
@sjwhitworth your CEO was also quite a dude.
@heathr the real question is did @Mike_FTW pay Martin Scorsese? ;)
.@evernote&#39;s Hello app seems to be a brilliant tool with one stupid assumption - that you scan business cards where you collect them.
@British_Airways it seems to be impossible to set your website to English if reading from germany (using Google Chrome).
@destraynor Great talk at #WebSummit. Glad I&#39;m not the only one against Stacked Bar Charts! Is there ever any use for them?
Congrats to @Lock8_me from @Satagonet for their #DisruptBerlin victory! http://bit.ly/HESmFX&nbsp;

@British_Airways no need to phone - your tech team can just try to change location/language in Chrome - it&#39;s broken. Works in IE, not Chrome
@simplybastow haha - glad you like it!
@TripIt you support Yahoo! Mail integration now, but not from http://yahoo.co.uk&nbsp;. Why??
@herbBlurb @FrancescaaJames we (@Satagonet)were one of the first UK companies to get crowd-equity funding via @Seedrs. Happy to talk!
Wow Google Adords is complicated these days. I guess they&#39;re not targeting the &quot;local florist&quot; market these days!
@leemallon tomorrow morning? 10am on Skype?
@simplybastow here&#39;s a little explanation. Hope you don&#39;t mind me embedding your tweet in there: http://bit.ly/1cBP84v&nbsp;
Just got some kind og @Evernote bonus for being a @O2 customer. Not sure what it is but nice anyway. Clever Evernote marketing people!
although it doesn&#39;t seem these @Evernote points can actually be spent on much if you&#39;re already a Premium user. Oh well!
Learnt about @BliuBliu from @benjrooney&#39;s #DisruptBerlin article (didn&#39;t meet them myself) Looks promising for my German learning.
I wish @benjrooney had come by the @satagonet #DisruptBerlin table and written a nice story about us too!
@BliuBliu I&#39;m kind of liking your product - but I&#39;m not exactly clear what I&#39;m doing (!). Is there *never* a translation to help you?
.@BliuBliu and @Readlang should meet and have babies.
@BliuBliu you know I really don&#39;t guess the word just by seeing it repeated (despite best efforts). I think eventually you should translate.
Now my daily language learning is @BliuBliu, @duolingo, @memrise, and @Readlang. I should probably just speak more German.
Rumour is that @adamhorner is well jealous of the 2.5h battery life my HP laptop gets.
@BliuBliu didn&#39;t see translations. Was using Chrome in Win8. Will try again later.
@BliuBliu no tooltip
@BliuBliu @Readlang no you don&#39;t. Fix it please. :p
@BliuBliu so when I mouseover I currently only have option to underline/de-underline a word as unknown/known
Actually received my @ryanair €10 voucher for using their hotel booking website.
@BliuBliu no I was on Chrome on laptop
@Readlang @BliuBliu well es&gt;es makes sense if it is the definition shown in Spanish, rather than translation - then you stick in language.
@Readlang @BliuBliu still not working for me on Chrome. Should it work in the drilling or surfing bit? Neither work.
Tried to use a voucher on the @Ryanair website and the whole site crashed. I&#39;m probably the first person to try and redeem one.
@Ryanair hi! It worked the 2nd time. It just takes ages to go through your whole purchase system again. Thanks.
@rememberthemilk can my Evernote reminders sync the other way so my RTM tasks appear in Evernote too?
@rememberthemilk done!

@crunchbase ah true. I tried that but it called me &quot;facebookuser683805300&quot; so I assumed it was not the right account. Thanks.
@andreasklinger I know that feeling! =&gt; @Zendesk and @getsatisfaction. Unfortunately GS went crazy expensive so not for startups now. :(
hey @HotGloo - why you no have referral programme so I get freebies for pimping you? :p

.@streak just started email tracking feature in Gmail. Interesting. Would like to see privacy issues mentioned though http://bit.ly/1cuhEAx&nbsp;
Email tracking within Gmail using @Streak. Good or bad? How does it work? Privacy implications?
@Streak any eta on the Gmail conversation view bug/problem fix?
@buro9 @Streak but I wonder how it works vis-a-vis old Exchange read notifications. i.e. does the person I send to get asked for permission?
@buro9 @Streak or is it inserting a tracking pixel, like a marketing email image?
@buro9 @Streak could it even increase chances of getting caught in Gmail spam filters?
@buro9 @Streak sent
@Streak everything of tracked emails works, except the Tracked Emails folder remains empty... Bug? Seems &#39;from:me&#39; breaks it. Search ok w/o
Anyone want to place a wager on when @Streak will get bought by Google? I guess ~6months and wager a virtual tracking cookie.
@Streak forget that - it works now!
@buro9 @Streak strangely the email I sent to my own @yahoo.co.uk email address is not getting picked up as viewed
I feel bad for kinda breaking the business model of the Internet, but it is a *lot* nicer browsing with AdBlock on. #fb

@cpinto that was definitely something I noticed this time! @seedcamp
@envato has Themeforest changed the way you browse templates? Want to browse by screenshots. Can only see useless icons now.
@envato_support I mean like this: http://awesomescreenshot.com/01b20srj6a&nbsp; I was sure previously I could browse by screenshot.
@envato_support it&#39;s too difficult to browse hundreds or thousands of templates where all you see if an icon.
@envato_support I think it must be that I have found themes elsewhere before, where I get full view, then been referred to buy from you
@envato_support hover-over helps. Thanks for support!

@HPSupport different if I was trying to stretch use from 5h to 7h. But to get even 5h it seems I would have to just... not use it. :/
@putt1ck at least it gives them hope! I can&#39;t even manage a half-day in a cafe. @adamhorner seems to be getting genuine 7h. Correct Adam?

Should I still head to Gatwick now for my 4pm flight if @Easyjet latest says it will takeoff at 7pm? Might as well wait at home?
@No1Traveller your website doesn&#39;t really work. I tried to book a lounge for later today and it said it was &quot;in the past&quot;.

So apparently my @easyjet flight EZY5437 will take-off on time, but land 2h late. What does that mean?
@jeffseedrs what airport you in Jeff? I&#39;m on my way to Gatwick South. Not expecting a good time.
Apparently our flight was about the only one to leave the UK on time! #fb
@jeffseedrs ouch. Somehow my flight was actually on time. Apparently the only UK flight to be unaffected!

@unbounce 1st time user here. You realise your UI makes editing the white text in your templates kinda difficult?
@unbounce ok - now realise I can switch editor colour :)
@unbounce hehe. ok - Q for you - is there an easy way to insert a slideshow in an Unbounce page to auto change through a few images?
@unbounce maybe this is the answer: http://www.jengordon.com/how-to-embed-an-image-slider-to-your-unbounce-landing-page/&nbsp;… but this this page is unavailable: http://support.unbounce.com/entries/20159801-SlideDeck&nbsp;…

The Stansted Express isn&#39;t really an &quot;express&quot; if it stops at lots of stations. It&#39;s just a train that happens to end at Stansted Airport.

Using @MailChimp now and finding some 1st-time-user UI fail
@cpinto oh. good catch. I&#39;ll check it out now as I&#39;m trying to get this all working this morning.
@cpinto thanks. Seems similar to @PopcornMetrics who are in our @seedcamp batch. Will check it out. Also looked at intercom.io.
@cpinto haha, ok. I like outsourcing my due diligence on these tools, so thanks for the tips!! :D
@cpinto I might start with Mailchimp just to clean our lists for first couple emails until we can get sophisticated (and pay more).

@cpinto don&#39;t suppose you know how to import email addresses via csv to Streak? Not working for me and I don&#39;t expect help from @Streak

@cpinto jeez this is annoying. What&#39;s the point in csv import if you can&#39;t import email addresses @Streak argh!
@cpinto that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve done. It won&#39;t recognise the column in my csv &quot;Email addresses&quot; is the same as the @Streak column
@Streak you just made me look like an idiot. The HTML in your mail-merge emails gets stripped with no warning? WTF?! cc @cpinto

@akberzins this video is why I said you need to register BuzztaleS too http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frGLMtGsotc&nbsp;… Maybe some marketing angle too?

First ever spinning class. In Norwegian. - I completed a Session with my Nike+ FuelBand and earned... #nikeplus http://go.nike.com/04qdtgjl&nbsp;
@anneriechert watched the video. Sorry - you&#39;ll have to make do with a #Scottish #Man for now.
@NikeFuel my Fuelband SE has stopped responding - when I press button it only shows 1 red and white LED. Nothing else. Something wrong?
@filmiesUK sure thing. Email me steven@satago.co.uk
@TheLuluLife greetings from the Norwegian mountains. Do you like my g/f&#39;s Norwegian rose painting design umbrella?pic.twitter.com/bXUO7Ashw0
@NikeSupport once I plugged it in it seems to work normally now. Strange.
Spotted two Teslas in the local carpark in Norway this afternoon.
@NikeSupport wondering - 3 hours skiing and I didn&#39;t record any &quot;Hours Won&quot; - is that normal? Surely FuelBand would notice *some* motion?
@carlfawkes follow-up fyi:http://wp.me/pX2fG-bx&nbsp;
@NikeSupport yeah I&#39;ve only had it since Xmas. It did track movement for each piste run but no Hours Won. Has given me Wins B4 though.
@shahbazmajeed thanks! Best Wishes to you from Norway!
About to watch the Danish Queen&#39;s New Year speech. I won&#39;t understand so shall probably drink more...
@buro9 my gf&#39;s place in Norway. I just feel lazy/relaxed.pic.twitter.com/xD748Q4wcG
@ZipcarUK hello! The cc on my account has expired but fret ye not I&#39;ll update it once I&#39;m not holidaying.
Oh oh someone just screwed up the music at the Copenhagen Palace!

Probably too late to memorise the words to Auld Lang Syne for this year. Why can I never remember them?!
Happy New Year from Norway! Enjoy a glass or two! . Wine from @moet via Vivino: http://www.vivino.com/s/52c30345efc98&nbsp;
@tim_dempsey you&#39;ve just really confused my Danish family!

Oh wow a Christmas nice present from @ZipcarUK - a £48 penalty because my credit card expired!
@ZipcarUK I&#39;m on hold on the phone to you guys now. Hopefully get it sorted out.
Despite Natwest hiding their phone number very well on their website, there is still &quot;currently very high demand&quot; so I am on hold for ages..
@benrmatthews speaking of design, it seems to not be possible to read that article properly in a mobile. :/
In my continuing (usually failing) effort to make a functioning to-do list, I may copy @ryancarson and start using @trello. cc @adamhorner
Saving @trello articles about GTD to Evernote for the train to Oslo tomorrow.
@Jason what ever happened to your Open Angel thing?
Interesting. I thought Tannoy was a type of PA system - in fact it is a genericised tradename, like Hoover - and it&#39;s Scottish! @TannoyPro
If ever a company should have a novelty Twitter account with thousands of followers, it&#39;s @TannoyPro
@ZipcarUK I thought it was sorted out, and I thought I had made a payment but my account is still suspended. DMing details.
Why has my iPhone decided overnight to wipe my email accounts from my phone? :(
My train has a snowplough on the front. This is a good thing.
The more I read about @Trello the better it looks - even though I&#39;ve been using it already for months. Hoping to get good at GTD in 2014.

.@evernote business card scanning absolutely did not work for me (iPhone 4S). Support ticket submitted. :/
@cpinto hehe - yeah I used it before - it is very good, but I worry @LinkedIn does not support it any more. Also I want to export easily.
@cpinto and why am I paying for @evernote when they still can&#39;t get Business Card scanning right yet?? *sigh*
What&#39;s the most popular remote assistance software for startups to help on-board users? I&#39;m starting with @LogMeIn. @Soluto any good?
@LogMeIn everything worked nicely at 1st attempt. :)
@LogMeIn what you should do now is offer a special deal to @seedcamp companies. Europe&#39;s best startups! :))
Fascinating looking at heatmaps of photo location popularity. This one shows @dundeeunitedfc vs the neighbours http://bit.ly/1bLQRxs&nbsp;

Holy- badly-implemented document protection in Word Batman! You can edit the document once - after it&#39;s saved can&#39;t be edited again!
Almost every @publiseek email I receive has a picture of @leahculver in it, which is a bit weird.
@poojou @RosieLondoner probably Centotre on George Street http://www.centotre.com/&nbsp;
@buro9 ouch. You need a key buddy for the future I guess.
@ryanstenhouse not much this random Twitter follower can say to help you, but I hope you feel better soon mate! :) You&#39;re not a fraud.
I forgot that in London you should assume the trains are borked unless proven otherwise.
@putt1ck I miss my motorbike. Turning up to an investor meeting in leathers would be cool. :D
@putt1ck they can handle risk. Good indicator!
Debating Customer support software @Zendesk vs @JIRA https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7066633&nbsp; (aka me vs @adamhorner). THoughts?
@GrantTree you recommend @capital_list ? Lots of Angels there vs @AngelList?
@cpinto you&#39;ll have thoughts on this I bet: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7066633&nbsp;
@AlannaPetroff none for me sadly but thanks anyway!
@capital_list @GrantTree yeah that might be good. Should I just complete your online stuff or do we talk on the phone?
@capital_list @GrantTree fyi I&#39;m trying to raise £400k and got £140k committed so far. Approx £110k SEIS space left.
@GrantTree I should also speak to you guys about R&amp;D credits and TSB grants. I met @swombat years ago when trying a different startup...

@boomerang what exactly are these message credits that I have apparently run out of?
@ikirigin @brendanbaker I was planning on recreating your study when we close our round. Looks similar - interesting for UK startups.
@jackbremer you should check this out:http://mypermissions.com/&nbsp;
@boomerang yeah but what is a &quot;message&quot;. That might make sense to you but I use you to remind me about old emails. Those?
@copperrboom a beard?

Sick day. But I can see emails piling up. :/
Been using Boomerang http://boomeranggmail.com&nbsp; to schedule messages in Gmail or make emails go away until I&#39;m ready. Highly recommended.
