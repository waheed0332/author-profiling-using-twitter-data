Happy to be at the Privacy Identity Innovation conference #pii2012. Off to a great start with the regulators panel: http://www.privacyidentityinnovation.com/pii2012-seattle/pii2012-seattle-schedule&nbsp;…
Panel&#39;s mention of government access to a person&#39;s mobile location data underscores need for a new personal data architecture #pii2012.
Anne Toth @clean_freak says Google+ &quot;circles&quot; emulate how people share in real life (selectively) vs. Facebook broadcast sharing #pii2012.
Rob Sherman @rmsherman says Facebook grew from small &quot;trusted community of people&quot; to massively scaled network and privacy is key #pii2012.
Christine Herron @christine investor in @ark says @ark tries to respect privacy policies of each of the networks it aggregates #pii2012.
IMHO key is to create a personal data ecosystem in which &quot;doing the right thing&quot; is economically advantageous to its participants #pii2012.
Anne Toth, Google @clean_freak: &quot;set user expectations through your product interactions, not just through your privacy policy&quot; #pii2012.
Christine Herron @christine: &quot;Engineers are hoarders&quot; referring to desire of companies to collect and keep user data #pii2012
&quot;Permission by Design&quot;enable people to control/permission the collection, use, sharing, and monetization of their personal data #pii2012.
&quot;Privacy&quot; rhetoric focusses on minimization. Person-centered personal data ecosystem focuses on permissioned flow of personal data #pii2012.
Allison Cerra giving a great keynote at #pii2012 about findings from the &quot;Identity Shift&quot; study: http://www.theshiftonline.com/&nbsp;
Allison Cerra at #pii2012: &quot;Trust&quot; is more important than &quot;love&quot; in people&#39;s willingness to spend money with your company.
Allison Cerra at #pii2012: &quot;In the Identity Economy it is trust which matters, not love.&quot;
Allison Cerra at #pii2012: Consumers are becoming aware that &quot;if you&#39;re not the customer, you&#39;re the product&quot;.
#pii2012 Innovator Spotlight Demos are awesome so far: @AboutOne @BrandYourself.
#pii2012 @socialtechno &quot;data minimization&quot; is &quot;gathering the least amount of personal information necessary to perform a given function&quot;
#pii2012 @socialtechno for more on this see @Kim_Cameron Second Law of Identity: http://www.identityblog.com/?p=627&nbsp;
@xmlgrrl I see &quot;selective sharing&quot; part of person-centered permissioned collection, use, sharing, and monetization of personal data #pii2012
@4thibeau asked me about the economic value of trust that we are exploring in the #WEF Rethinking Personal Data project at #pii2012.
*Trusted* personal data ecosystem unlocks value by person-centered aggregating, verifying, permissioning, sharing of personal data #pii2012
Wow!  @larrydownes in discussion with Andrew Keen @ajkeen about &quot;Digital Vertigo&quot; at #pii2012.
LOVED Andrew Keen&#39;s response to my question at #pii2012. Cf. my 2010 interview with @ajkeen on &quot;Digital Enlightenment&quot;:http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/16/keen-on-marc-davis-why-social-is-changing-everything-tctv/&nbsp;…
@ajkeen gave impassioned, articulate response about need to found digital society and economy on empowered digital individual #pii2012.
@kevinmarks depends on the political economy of these new &quot;nation state&quot; social networks and who has what rights over what data #pii2012
Looking forward to giving my talk at #pii2012 on &quot;Rethinking Personal Data for Mobile Social Media&quot; at 10:05 am today: http://www.privacyidentityinnovation.com/pii2012-seattle/pii2012-seattle-schedule&nbsp;…
@clean_freak It was great to begin grappling with (mobile) personal data and privacy issues together back in the day at Yahoo! #pii2012 :-).
@AlexKilpatrick Not everyone to every photo and not all parties have the same rights: multiparty rights are complex, but workable #pii2012.
@aweigend at #pii2012: we are seeing &quot;the shift from attribute-based identity to relationship-based identity&quot; -- totally agree.
Del Harvey @delbius gets it! User-permissioned use of purchase history for personal product recommendations vs. tracking for ads #pii2012
&quot;Small Data and Personal Identity Management&quot; panel is a &quot;crossing the chasm&quot; experience with @ShaneGreen on the innovator side #pii2012.

Excited and honored to be heading out on red eye to #NSTIC event tomorrow at White House #personaldata.
To what extent will #NSTIC support strong people-centered encryption such that personas could not be mappable by an IDP back to the person?
Ari Schwartz says &quot;The current username and password system is broken&quot; at #NSTIC meeting in DC.
Very glad to see a UK speaker about how #NSTIC is not just a US &quot;national&quot; strategy, but also looking at international identity issues.
Ari Schwartz talked about increasing trust in the identity system to remove friction in online transactions at #NSTIC meeting.
Ian Glazer @iglazer from Gartner up next on a panel at #NSTIC meeting.
@cmort from http://Salesforce.com&nbsp; at #NSTIC: &quot;Password resets and management of credentials can be quite expensive to us as an organization&quot;.
Wondering if anyone will speak to how #NSTIC relates to the question of how online identity will be foundational to our continued democracy.
@iglazer on how #NSTIC discussion is moving from technology, to policy, to business questions.
I want to be my own trusted IDP for me, but could my own server bear the cost and liability of being a trusted identity provider? #NSTIC.
Will online social reputation systems enable dynamic, even &quot;micro&quot; trust frameworks to evolve and vice versa? #NSTIC
At #NSTIC thinking about @aweigend at #pii2012 talking about &quot;the shift from attribute-based identity to relationship-based identity&quot;.
@robkrugman from @Broadridge at #NSTIC talking about moving from B2C to C2B where people are in control of the data they share.
@robkrugman from @Broadridge at #NSTIC talking about likelihood of multiple special purpose trust frameworks for finance, health, etc.
@iglazer advocating user at the center model for #NSTIC so person can see who has access to their data across multiple trust frameworks.
@cmort from http://Salesforce.com&nbsp; at #NSTIC talking about correlated user location data broker as valuable scenario for fraud prevention.
@iglazer:&quot;The evolution toward federated identity would mean that our identities are no longer owned by parties other than ourselves&quot; #NSTIC

Tom Smedinghoff @smedinghoff, Chair of the American Bar Association Identity Management Legal Task Force, speaking now at #ID3RightsBytes.
@smedinghoff: trust elements required for identity transactions are similar to trust elements needed for other transactions #ID3RightsBytes.
@smedinghoff: we are working out the specific &quot;system rules&quot; and &quot;enforcement mechanisms&quot; for identity transactions #ID3RightsBytes.
@smedinghoff: @ABAesq Identity Management Legal Task Force is investigating system rules and mechanisms for trust frameworks #ID3RightsBytes
@JoshGalper from @Personal: 95% of the data in your life is data created by others about you #ID3RightsBytes.
@JoshGalper from @Personal: &quot;The legal framework is the product&quot; #ID3RightsBytes.
Dazza Greenwood talking about &quot;Draft Trust Framework System Rules for Personal Data&quot; http://civics.com/model-trust-framework/&nbsp;… at #ID3RightsBytes.

Jeremy Grant from @NSTICNPO talking about the need for &quot;a common framework that supports multiple trust frameworks&quot; #ID3RightsBytes.
Jeremy Grant from @NSTICNPO: setting up identity ecosystem is like creation of (interoperable) ATM ecosystem in banking #ID3RightsBytes.
Jeremy Grant @NSTICNPO: any strategy that relies on &quot;congress will pass a law&quot; is &quot;likely setting itself up for failure&quot; #ID3RightsBytes.
Jeremy Grant @NSTICNPO: looking to Trust Frameworks to solve key legal+technical challenges in the identity ecosystem #ID3RightsBytes.
@smedinghoff: we will rely on &quot;private law&quot; and &quot;system rules&quot; to determine &quot;who is responsible for what&quot; re: personal data #ID3RightsBytes.
@smedinghoff raises the very apt VISA analogy for large scale, private system rules for trusted transactions #ID3RightsBytes.
But is &quot;private law&quot; enough to protect the rights of individuals (human rights, property rights, civil rights)? #ID3RightsBytes.
Dorothy Attwood: the way internet works today from a legal perspective is kind of &quot;wacky&quot; #ID3RightsBytes.
Dorothy Attwood&#39;s example of &quot;wacky&quot; internet from legal POV: how cookies are placed by a 3rd party on somebody&#39;s webpage #ID3RightsBytes.
@ShaneGreen @Personal talking about the personal importance and value of the personal data people carry on their phones #ID3RightsBytes.
@ShaneGreen: single most used data in their system is passwords and @Personal will soon enable secure sharing of passwords #ID3RightsBytes.
Christine Varney: &quot;Until it&#39;s easy and simple and intuitive, people really don&#39;t care (about managing personal data)&quot; #ID3RightsBytes.
Christine Varney on &quot;unlimited liability&quot; risk: &quot;There have not been successful plaintiff class action lawsuits on privacy&quot; #ID3RightsBytes.
Christine Varney: user-centric control of data is a means to an end--it will enable the new types of commerce we want #ID3RightsBytes.
Ooops! My tweets from #ID3RightsBytes related to &quot;Dorothy Attwood&quot; are actually related to &quot;Ellen Blackler&quot; @eblackler.
Dazza Greeenwood #ID3RightsBytes: multistakeholder approach has technical, legal, and business working groups (same in #WEF RPD Tiger Team).
Question asked about needed regulation at #ID3RightsBytes. What about fixing digital due process: http://www.digitaldueprocess.org&nbsp; ?
Scott David: &quot;Facebook sells us ourselves, but a higher fidelity version of ourselves.&quot; #ID3RightsBytes.
Scott David: What does rule-making look like at scale that can move faster, but not too fast? #ID3RightsBytes.
Scott David (alluding to Erving Goffman): &quot;We offload our cognition to institutions&quot; #ID3RightsBytes.
#ID3RightsBytes @JoshGalper @Personal: &quot;MyData&quot; Button allows students to download their own data: http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/technology/data-interoperability/&nbsp;…
David Riley: person-centric personal data model is &quot;empowering the individual to be a participant in the networked economy&quot; #ID3RightsBytes.
Capt. Russell Schilling: design intelligibility, simplicity, clear mental model and UX from start for personal data systems #ID3RightsBytes.
Related to persistent ID, David Riley mentioned &quot;Voluntary Universal Healthcare Identifier&quot; project: http://gpii.info/index.php&nbsp; #ID3RightsBytes
@ShaneGreen @Personal: Shift to person-centered personal data ecosystem will be disruptive and swift when it happens #ID3RightsBytes.
@ShaneGreen @Personal: Only thing standing in the way of disruptive shift to person-centric is massive user adoption #ID3RightsBytes.
Transition from the early web when each person had their own domain to the web now where each person is owned by a domain #ID3RightsBytes.
Christine Varney: Is there a regulatory tilt that would encourage the commercialization of privacy by the private sector? #ID3RightsBytes.
http://www.myname.com&nbsp; owned by me is not the same web as http://www.company.com/myname&nbsp; #ID3RightsBytes.
@ShaneGreen @Personal: Solving online form-filling well could actually have a positive impact on national GDP #ID3RightsBytes.

#pii2010 &quot;Mobile Location Data and the World Around Us&quot; panel was same time as #FB Places (http://bit.ly/bJeDSR) announcement yesterday.
enjoyed being on @swildstrom&#39;s &quot;Personal Data Stores and Portability&quot;panel with @drummondreed  @dbboardman @denisetayloe at #pii2010.
@BerinSzoka: &quot;Advertising is a public good which solves the problem of how you pay for information&quot; #pii2010.
@jeffjarvis It was @BerinSzoka that said: &quot;Advertising is a public good which solves the problem of how you pay for information&quot; #pii2010.
Thx Natalie &amp; Marc @TechPolicy for bringing us all together to wrestle with privacy, identity, and innovation in Seattle last week #pii2010.
@betsymas @BerinSzoka @ScottLDavid great discussions about &quot;privacy by design&quot; &quot;privacy by experimentation&quot; &quot;data-driven policy&quot; #pii2010.
Great talking with @ajkeen about whether nascent &quot;digital enlightenment&quot; will have more Anglo-Scottish or Franco-European model #pii2010.
Who was the #pii2010 audience member who suggested &quot;Personal Data Server&quot; as new name for PDS in response to @drummondreed &#39;s question?

So excited to be watching @NASA TV with @SheriCecilDavis and both of us tweeting about @MarsCuriosity #MSL #CuriosityRover.
Remembering watching #Apollo, then #Viking while watching with hope of a safe landing for @MarsCuriosity.
Awesome that we are getting live telemetry from @MarsCuriosity #MSL #CuriosityRove relayed from #Odyssey!
Supersonic parachute deployed! Go @MarsCuriosity!! #MSL.
Powered flight descent! @MarsCuriosty #SkyCrane descending now.
&quot;Touchdown confirmed! We&#39;re safe on Mars!&quot; @MarsCuriosity.
Humanity can do truly amazing things: safely land @MarsCuriosity on Mars and have engineers sincerely hug each other. Go #MSL and #JPL!
Genius!: @NASA: Here&#39;s a better picture where you can see the @MarsCuriosity shadow in Gale Crater on Marspic.twitter.com/hYdYXRQK
I just love the use of the 1st Person voice in @MarsCuriosity&#39;s tweets. So HALesque #MSL.
@MarsCuriosity&#39;s landing is the result of  when we &quot;dare mighty things&quot; together. Bravo @NASA!
The control room for @MarsCuriosity had a controller with a Mohawk, a man with earrings, and female controllers. Progress!
@MarsCuriosity is HUGE: 10 ft long x 9 ft wide x 7ft tall and literally weighs a ton: http://marsmobile.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/rover/&nbsp;… #MSL.
Helpful advice from a Seattle local: &quot;If you carry an umbrella, everyone will know you&#39;re not from here.&quot;

really intrigued by Paola Antonelli&#39;s upcoming exhibit at MoMA &quot;Talk  to Me&quot; http://bit.ly/a9ZbpY #scs2011.
the fetishization of books misses how computation can help us reclaim many of the benefits of  Wlaler Ong&#39;s notion of &quot;orality&quot;  #scs2011.
computation merges  Barthes&#39; &quot;text&quot; and Ong&#39;s &quot;orality&quot; to enable personalization, adaptation, dialogue, and participation #scs2011.
essential reading IMHO--Roland Barthes&#39; &quot;From Work to Text&quot; http://bit.ly/hyXJEn, &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; http://bit.ly/d4Jbi8 #scs2011.

James Bridle (@stml ) talks about William Gibson&#39;s (@GreatDismal) work as &quot;Network Realism&quot;-- i.e., science fiction of the present #scs2011.

@BarackObama please now truly deliver on the audacity of hope that a progressive democratic agenda can bring America and the world.
@BarackObama in beautiful communitarian form says: &quot;The task of perfecting our union moves forward [...] because of you.&quot;
Thank goodness @BarackObama truly seems energized to take on the challenges of the next four years.
@BarackObama: &quot;What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on earth.&quot;
@BarackObama&#39;s political vision is not based on the &quot;individual&quot;, or the &quot;family&quot;, but on us as a &quot;community&quot;: the United States of America.

The World Economic Forum Summit on the Global Agenda 2012 in Dubai, UAE is starting in a few minutes #wef #globalagendapic.twitter.com/11BY9D6Z
I&#39;m excited to be in Dubai for this year&#39;s World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on Data Driven Development Meeting #wef #globalagenda.
Professor Klaus Schwab refers to the #WEF #GlobalAgenda Summit as a &quot;global brainstorming meeting&quot; to help inform the WEF&#39;s annual agenda.
1000 global thought leaders in 88 #GlobalAgenda councils to discuss the ideas and issues that should be addressed at #WEF #davos 2013.
&quot;We have no global governance. What we have is a multilateral system which is unable to address the challenges of the 21st century.&quot; #WEF
#globalagenda #wef (male) command and control hierarchy contrasted with (female) networks as different models for organization/governance.
#globalagenda #wef Gordon Brown: &quot;The next panel cannot have three men on it.&quot;

Enjoyed @IngridBurbey talk at #MobiCASE: &quot;When Will You Be at the Office? Predicting Future Locations and Times&quot; http://bit.ly/9YJZ3P.
Made it to #dld13. Great to hear so many speakers grappling with the challenges and opportunities of big data and personal data.
Enjoying seeing data/media/design friends at #dld13: @slavin_fpo @kenyatta @timleberecht @jeffjarvis @montymetzger @hirshberg @aaronkoblin.
I haven&#39;t yet heard any speakers talk about coming European Union Data Regulation and its relation to big data and personal data #dld13.
IMHO big deal is how Big Data and Personal Data are becoming regulatory, political, and personal issues, not just tech or biz issues #dld13.
@jeffjarvis The internet is not media like traditional media, but a platform. Platforms enable others to build new things upon it. #DLD13
@jeffjarvis: Journalists need to help build the platform (of the internet), not just produce content (on the internet). #dld13.
@jeffjarvis: difference between mass media and media that engages a (signed in) individual using their personal and contextual data. #dld13
@alecjross onstage with @nickbilton. Alec has great job title: &quot;Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#39;s Senior Advisor for Innovation&quot; #DLD13
@alecjross said he doesn&#39;t think every public official should be on Twitter because it would be &quot;boring&quot; #DLD13.
I disagree with @alecjross: With government officials we need *more* access, accountability, and participation in our connected world.
@AlecJRoss I think being on twitter is important for public officials so they can be tweeted about and messaged to by citizens #DLD13.
@PaulNemitz thanks for the pointers! I imagine you are familiar with: http://www.weforum.org/issues/rethinking-personal-data&nbsp;…
I&#39;m honored to be in &quot;Thriving in a Hyperconnected World&quot; discussion in WEF Global Agenda Outlook 2013 @wef @wefgac:http://wef.ch/outlook2013&nbsp;
World Economic Forum Global Agenda Outlook 2013: http://wef.ch/outlook2013&nbsp; with @marcedavis @eurohumph in dialogue moderated by @RodBeckstrom.
Global Agenda Outlook 2013 http://lnkd.in/ApfDp8&nbsp;
In &quot;Finance your Idea&quot; #DLD13 http://dld-conference.com/events/452&nbsp; panelists said people are now more comfortable sharing data and having their data shared.
Apparent comfort with data collection/sharing is an illusion: most people have no idea what really happens with their personal data #DLD13.
Unlike physical architecture, digital architecture is invisible and highly varied, so it&#39;s hard to form normative expectations #DLD13.
Andrew Keen @ajkeen will be moderating a discussion in a few minutes at #DLD13.  Watch live at: http://dld-conference.com/conferences/17&nbsp;
@ajbraun People would care if: they felt they were ripped off in an unfair value exchange; they knew that data could be used to harm them.
@cwodtke Yes, I should have said digital architecture is &quot;highly variable&quot; to capture sense of &quot;varied&quot; and &quot;always in motion&quot; #DLD13.
@ajkeen asks if migration to the cloud will make our data more secure or less secure? @carsonsweet replies it can be more secure #DLD13.
Audience expresses fear of the cloud: &quot;I don&#39;t know where my data is!&quot; @carsonsweet: &quot;The good news is some of your providers may.&quot; #DLD13.
@carsonsweet: How data gets compromised: they get something on your phone; phishing get your password; access to actual vault #DLD13.
@ajkeen: &quot;If we are increasingly defined by our data and our data is owned by big cloud companies, shouldn&#39;t we be worried?&quot; #DLD13.
Fantastic talk by @barabasi underway explaining the structure and dynamics of scale-free networks at #DLD13.pic.twitter.com/u18spwYF
@barabasi: &quot;global predictability&quot; results from patterns of our movement around the globe and location correlating to behavior #DLD13.
@barabasi: we prefer people like ourselves, don&#39;t venture far from home, and have very predictable behaviors #DLD13.pic.twitter.com/1AcTJpu2
@barabasi: personal location predictable at 93% accuracy for most people and for very few at less than 80% #DLD13.pic.twitter.com/ZTjjSAC4
@dpatil: not enough to have data--what puts you in a position to win are people who interpret data and can tell stories with data #DLD13
Based on @dpatil comments on #DLD13 &quot;Patterns that Connect&quot; panel I offer a neologism for the skills that he spoke of: &quot;data hermeneutics&quot;.
@Werner: nothing quicker will erode customer trust than using their data for a purpose other than that for which they gave it to you #DLD13.
Thanks @lumoren! Philosophy and literary/media theory are key disciplines for understanding and shaping our connected world #DLD13.
@lumoren I find phenomenology (esp. Merleau-Ponty) helpful for semantics and pragmatics of how data connects to people and the world #DLD13.
Great quote by @dtapscott: &quot;The old institutions fought the internet and the internet won.&quot; #DLD13.
@TonyHsieh offers insights about how @zappos designs its office space to encourage physical interactions, e.g., having one entrance #DLD13.

@Floridi at #OnlifeEU workshop talking about how &quot;onlife&quot; is the merging of online/offline, digital/analog, virtual/physical.
Jean-Gabriel Ganascia: &quot;It is difficult with traditional concepts to understand the present.&quot; #OnlifeEU.
Jean-Gabriel Ganascia: Models of hyperconnectivity: topology of networks: taxis=&gt;kosmos; dynamics of networks: MIMD=&gt;Grid #OnlifeEU.
@sclopit In the hyperconnected world the distinction between real and virtual blurs as the web and the world become one #OnlifeEU.
Judith Simon: you can&#39;t understand sociotechnical systems just from the perspective of taxis; you need kosmos as well  #OnlifeEU.
Dr. Judith Simon talking about &quot;governance as game design&quot; and &quot;Distributed Epistemic Responsibility&quot; at #OnlifeEU.
Prof. Mireille Hildebrandt talked about &quot;Joint Attention&quot;--which is in my talk too--at #OnlifeEU. Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_attention&nbsp;…
The discussion of &quot;private&quot; vs. &quot;public&quot; space at #OnlifeEU so far ignores the most prevalent space on the web: &quot;corporate&quot; space.
Marko Ahtisaari @moia talking about &quot;what kind of world we ought to be making and building&quot; at #OnlifeEU.
Marko Ahtisaari @moia says we are still looking for the dominant pattern for interaction and design for smart phones #OnlifeEU.
@moia wants to enable people to have their heads up again to experience the world around them when they use their smartphones #OnlifeEU.
@balaitous is giving his inaugural reaction to the Onlife Manifesto now. I&#39;m up next at #onlifeEU: http://scic.ec.europa.eu/streaming/index.php?es=2&amp;sessionno=240c945bb72980130446fc2b40fbb8e0&nbsp;…
@sclopit Thx: 1) &quot;My data is me&quot; (self); 2) &quot;My data is mine&quot; (property); 3) &quot;My data is by me&quot; (speech) #OnlifeEU.
Google faces the ethical problem of traditional online advertising business: &quot;If you&#39;re not the customer, you&#39;re the product.&quot; #OnlifeEU.
@eurohumph Key is for a corporation to have a sustainable business model that is itself ethical and human-centered, not just CSR #OnlifeEU.
@eurohumph with the right business model and execution it is possible for a company to &quot;do good and do well&quot; at the same time #OnlifeEU.
@kostasrossoglou says the Onlife Manifesto is not easy enough to read and reminds him of a text on the sociology of law #OnlifeEU.
@kostasrossoglou: individual needs right and ability to keep online identity and offline identity separate #OnlifeEU.
@charles_ess @nickblow digital feudalism disruptors: human rights, personal property rights, and private &amp; public digital spaces #OnlifeEU.
Athena Bourka says &quot;privacy requires choice&quot;, ability to say yes/no to certain terms and to negotiate terms of data sharing/use #OnlifeEU.
Dr. Kai Rannenberg talking about unintended consequences of requirement for &quot;real name&quot; identity in many social networks today #OnlifeEU.

Someone once said: &quot;Privacy is DRM for my personal data.&quot; #personaldata #privacy #pcloud.
@BenWerd personal data can be my credit card info, cell phone number, medical records...people don&#39;t want to control sharing these? #pcloud
@BradTem: you can&#39;t sell the personal cloud on the basis of privacy, but you can by selling control, innovation, speed, scalability #pcloud.
@BradTem: people want &quot;control&quot; so they can choose to have other parties do cool things with their personal data on their behalf #pcloud.
@dnm54 @BradTem But remember, running your own PC used to be just for us nerds. Imagine personal clouds as consumer appliances #pcloud.
@JoeJohnston doing a great job talking about the need to &quot;instantaneously provision&quot; personal clouds for developers #pcloud.
@ilparone asks &quot;How can we use our own data to have better interfaces to the world around us?&quot; #pcloud.

@drummondreed will lead a session at #IIW about &quot;Will Personal Clouds help solve the Identity Problem?&quot; #personaldata #privacy #pcloud.
@Johannes_Ernst at #IIW on the Personal Cloud #pcloud excellent 2x2: standalone | connected X personal control | non personal control.
@Johannes_Ernst #IIW: mainframe (connected/notmine), PC (notconnected/mine), web co (connected/notmine), personal cloud (connected/mine).
The Internet Identity Workshop #IIW is packed and buzzing: http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/#personaldata&nbsp; #pcloud #vrm #digitalself #privacy.
@dsearls: &quot;Personal Clouds give us [individuals] control over data&quot; #iiw #pcloud #personaldata.
Personal Clouds not just a technical question, but a political question: what rights will we have in our digital societies &amp; economies? #IIW
@Johannes_Ernst on layers of Personal Cloud choices: Hosting, Platform, Apps, Interaction w/ World (TOS, access controls) #IIW #pcloud.
@Johannes_Ernst: &quot;We do not know yet what will be the &#39;VisiCalc&#39; of Personal Clouds&quot; #IIW #pcloud #personaldata.
@dsearls talking about how #VRM and Personal Clouds #pcloud relate at #IIW.
@dsearls: &quot;#VRM + #CRM = $0 trillion market&quot; #IIW.
@dsearls: &quot;Personal Data vaults/lockers/stores now &#39;Personal Clouds&#39;&quot; #IIW #pcloud.
@dsearls: #VRM conversation has become a subset of the Personal Cloud conversation...sign of maturity and a good thing.&quot; #IIW #pcloud.
@dsearls: &quot;You are &#39;users&#39; of Google; you are not their &#39;customers&#39;&quot; #IIW #pcloud #personaldata.
&quot;If you&#39;re not the customer, you&#39;re the product&quot;--so imagine the services for which we will be customers in a #pcloud world #IIW.
@dsearls: &quot;Contracts are laws we make unto ourselves&quot;. #IIW #pcloud.
@dsearls: &quot;We are civilizing virtual space. That&#39;s all we&#39;re doing with terms.&quot; #IIW #VRM #PCloud.
@dsearls: &quot;Difference between Terms of Service and a Privacy Policy is that a TOS is enforceable, a Privacy Policy is not.&quot; #IIW #pcloud.
@evanwolf points to Uniform Commercial Code http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Commercial_Code&nbsp;… during @dsearls session at #IIW in hope of data contract standardization.
@Steve_Lockstep @dsearls I agree with @Steve_Lockstep about the &quot;metasystem of contract law&quot; on which contracts rely #IIW #pcloud.
@dsearls led great sessions today at #IIW again.  Hearing summaries now...
I could lead a session tomorrow at #IIW on models/metaphors of what is &quot;personal data&quot; that implicitly inform policy and tech. Any interest?
@kevinmarks Does your retweet mean: 1) You want to lead session; 2) You want to co-lead session; 3) You want to participate in session #IIW?
@kevinmarks Cool!  We&#39;re on: &quot;Metaphors and Models of What Is &#39;Personal Data&#39;: Implications for Policy and Technology&quot; tomorrow at #IIW.

@map650 on &quot;gamification of permissions&quot;: &quot;If people can do Farmville, they should be able to do their own personal cloud&quot; #C32011.
