@bluishorange What about it turned you off ?
@ericaendicott yay! Exciting. 
There’s absolutely a group discount. Talk to Marci at aneventapart dot com.
@bluishorange I thought it was much more open ended than that, and brave for mainstream TV. No views, including atheists’, were discounted.
@bluishorange That’s just my interpretation of course. (But I am pretty sure I share many of your sensitivities.)
@bluishorange I grew up with the same chip.
@beardChamp Thank you.

.@TiroTypeworks @nicewebtype It is only useful when you know the size of the device. Useful for digital signs. Not for #RWD.
.@TiroTypeworks @nicewebtype Purpose of experiment is to allow designer to set type at an exact size on any specific device.
.@typofonderie @TiroTypeworks @nicewebtype True unless font has built-in scaling logic. 21st century hinting!

@craigcook @abookapart Want to pitch one? Bear in mind, ABA is about laser-focused topics, not overviews.
@aecheylon Oh, I can never lose *that*.  ;)
@macguitar Yes, it is brilliant design.
@macguitar Would you be willing to come on The Big Web Show to talk about your design philosophy, your company, etc?
@craigcook Even that is too broad for ABA (although it would make a great book for New Riders or O&#39;Reilly).
