@TDBank_US Your new design for bill pay is extremely confusing. It was better the way it was before... Fewer clicks an simpler options.
@TDBank_US Also, why are you processing my future payments now? I should be able to cancel my scheduled payments before their scheduled date
@TDBank_US I actually can&#39;t believe I cannot edit a payment I scheduled for April 1st... I used to be able to edit payments the day before.
