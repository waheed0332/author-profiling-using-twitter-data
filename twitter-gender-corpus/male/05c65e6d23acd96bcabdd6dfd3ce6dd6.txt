Tokyo HBS Event presenter Andrew Erlich, NOT AN ADCOM (says he interviewed people): See http://bit.ly/bcyyQG
Japanese candidates: While HBS interviews maybe conducted by alumni, no one in Japan has been offered that option for a number of years.
Andrew mentioned that interviews could be conducted by alumni interviewers, as well as admissions (campus and hub).
However this interview information was general and not specific to Japan.
HBS does have a &quot;small alumni interviewing network.&quot; See http://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/interview.html. I think these must be rare.
