Why go the extra mile? http://fb.me/1NSeuXl2G&nbsp;
Agency said they wouldn&#39;t work with an #illustrator because they&#39;re too expensive.  They prefer a designer to illustrate the project.  WHAT!
@o_fishel The client said a designer will do the illustration work for hire.  The illustrator will want more because of global usage rights.
This looks like a day in Dayton if caught on film.http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=316AzLYfAzw&nbsp;…

Who&#39;s watching @thepitch? #thepitch
#thepitch.  95% of the agencies claim they have the best creative.
#ThePitch Wonder how many agencies will show off their awards to the prospect as part of their pitch?
#ThePitch HELP!!! What song pops in your mind?? @ThePitch_AMC
@novosedlik #thepitch Should be interesting to see where the client goes: customer or the old fashion brand. @ThePitch_AMC
@radbcc #ThePitch I find it interesting every firm says they&#39;re the best.  The best at what?? @ThePitch_AMC
#thePitch Hive... burrrrr. What about the hourly rate or overtime rate?
#ThePitch @ThePitch_AMC  Now they&#39;re hitting the customer&#39;s emotions.  Very good.  Interesting to see what the client does.
#thePitch @ThePitch_AMC  Hive seemed to pull out the old tried and true where FKM hit on the customer emotions as word of mouth advertising.
#thepitch @ThePitch_AMC  OK, both agencies have over 100 folks.  Wonder what the client paid the 2 firms to make the presentation? ProBono?
@FKMagency @ThePitch_AMC #thepitch.  Found your firm understands the emotional side of the brand.  Congratulations.
