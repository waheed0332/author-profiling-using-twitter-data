@ColinBuckle1 I have a day trip to Edinburgh on Tuesday!!!!
@_Greggor Radetskys March!!
Sitting on the 0745 to Edinburgh......long day today but Edinburgh in only 3hrs 37mins seems brilliant!!
Rattling through Doncaster
That&#39;s not bad 1hr and 9 mins Peterborough to York.......
Newcastle in just over 2 hrs is impressive
Berwick upon Tweed and only 5 mins behind time....3 hrs from Peebo !! We are 5 mins behind time and it wouldn&#39;t happen in Japan but hey ho!
I can see the North Sea and it looks bleak and rough out there
Waiting to depart Waverley, should be back in Peebo for 2046..........
I&#39;d like to say the scenery on the coast North of Berwick is breathtaking,  the North Sea hitting the shore, but its dark can&#39;t see FA
One hour into journey, back in England we stop at Alnmouth!!! Never heard of it, can&#39;t see it but its there somewhere
They are now closing the cafe bar on the train 20 mins before Newcastle so they can tally up and open it with a new crew after Newcastle!!
Good news the cafe bar is now open, good job they didn&#39;t shut the electric engine down for 20 mins so they could do a staff change
I feel a bit of Roger Whittaker coming on at the next stop
Has someone moved Darlington, oh no the new driver can&#39;t find the throttle......get a bloody shift on mate
Next stop York......nice place, home of the Railway Museum
Having had a perfect journey this morning and a good start to this one, I fear between Darlington and York the driver has lost the throttle
It now transpires we are stopping at Newark Northgate....missed that one!! Why?....surely it closes after 6pm!!!!.......
@CLP07 consider yourself shoved!!
I think ASLEF got that tweet.....rattling along now only 2 mins behind schedule nearly York
4 mins late now as we approach Doncaster, I think a headlight must have gone out!!! Due in 1957 now, what a good year that was
Aha Doncaster, home of a very good fish market I&#39;m told...I wonder if its as good as the &quot;very very good £1 fish!&quot;
Floodlights on at the Keepmoat, who Doncaster playing?
Right play it right, give 3 rings on the bell, that means full up and oops can&#39;t stop at Newark.....7 mins behind time now
Must be Newark I think I can smell the sugar factory.......only another 30mins then Peebo
Now got some student sitting next to me its been empty all the way,just cos its reserved  doesn&#39;t mean you need to sit here, loads of room
.....And once again we will soon be rattling through Grantham, the only way to see it really!!
This student sitting next to me is reading a book called Cognative Psychology.....that must scare men off!!
Should be pulling in now but due to the wrong kind of darkness, perhaps the driver spilling coffee from his thermos still have 9 mins to go
Didn&#39;t get to the gym but managed just over a couple of miles around the lakes....wind and rain, same as Monday but still #feelinggood
I&#39;m not an Arsenal fan but Santos shouldn&#39;t even by paying in the Peterborough League he is so shit!!!

What a great sporting day. All my teams won, I love days like this
It amazes me that Managers Whittle on about refereeing mistakes which supposedly cost points. Perhaps it&#39;s what you do in the other 85 mins!
@_Greggor you&#39;re going all through the night!
What a nice day today......meet Tesco out of the way then Costa Coffee with a pastry I think watching the people walk past......nice
Sometimes you just want to kick them up the arse! #murdochmysteries
Getting Robbie Fowler to pronounce Germany / polish names at the Dortmund game was a slight mistake by Sky Sports
As I said earlier in week why is it always the referees fault....a game lasts 90 mins. you just need to score more than the opposition
So ITV degenerate the match into one decision......mm good for Roy Keane, respect..
Some football players are like caught fish.....they always seem Gutted!!
@_Greggor good luck in the 2nds today at thus rate England will be calling
My god they are still bleating on about that red card...they also interviewed 3 Man Utd fans outside ground, 2 Scotsmen and a South African

Mums dinner and mums home made rice pudding epic!!

Walk into a florist and the smell from the flowers is great, go into a bakers and the aroma wonderful, go into QD and it stinks of BO!!!
Just walked past Vale school at kicking out time, very poor standard of milfs waiting outside
&quot;@BillMcNish: @_GreggorI reckon if you go voyager the standard wouldn&#39;t be too bad .  Only you could take thus to another lever or Frisby!
Keith Stroud again, he&#39;s becoming a TV star. Derby v Leicester at the weekend and now Yeovil v Swindon!!

Good luck to @_Greggor whatever team he plays for today #uob #fightingrelegation
Is spending the afternoon in Cambs watching UoB v Anglia Rusking relegation decider
Afternoon with @_Greggor at football Didn&#39;t deserve to lose. Some great individuals but probably 2 bricks short of full hod
@CLP07 don&#39;t worry about the reserves, why not join the real RAF, you could see lots of nice places and play hockey on sand!!

Gym done 3 days in a row. Nice!
Has just fitted a new letterbox
@ella_bella_29 brilliant!
Tesco done this week. 48 pack of Weetabix gone up from £3.79 to £4.18. Another sign of the times

3 guys stuck in Windermere #bailforbeds, no thanks to our train companies @VirginTrains @northernrailorg who just cannot help charity
@marky_kirwan @drisebrow @_Greggor a worthy effort. Prize for most transport blags at least 11. Tired but still a team
Miguel Llera is a footballing tosser. Right hat, wrong sport #rugby
What a relaxing day, dinner cooking slowly doing housework, bought some picture frames. Running out of space on walls. Just chilling #lovely
@_Greggor @drisebrow @marky_kirwan  69 miles between 5th and 2nd... really great effort and that escape from Windermere would have done it
Not sure why it was all smiles at end of Reading v QPR, isn&#39;t the game about winning...mm where were the tears

Wow, fantastic salmon salad, flaked salmon, smoked salmon, fresh cooked prawns, croutons and mixed leaves. Home made dressing.
Home made dressing. Olive oil, balsamic vinegar, cayenne pepper and squeeze of lemon juice ,.. surprised myself
Thanks ITV,  Watching the cup final with radio 5 commentary. ITV insist on using bloody Ivy Tildsley and that Townsend. Is he irish!!!
&quot;@AaronWatts12: Mariner you cunt, what the fuck... the games only been going 20 mins. @_Greggor what&#39;s he on?
Well it took Laurel and Hardy 23 minutes to get David Moyes in the commentary by discussing Community shield rivals!!
Mcmanaman is so frustrating, just have a dig dont go back and pass him again
Time for that inevitable quote &quot; this has all the makings of a 0-0&quot;
Sometimes the good guys do win
To accomplish great things we must not only act but also dream not only plan but also BELIEVE
@_Greggor its that Herb Brooks moment

Here we are then, 0655 to London KX...going to be a long day
Waiting for this train to leave it is clear some of these guys have had a life sentence of commuting...my 10 years was bad enough!
It is clear this time of day, who rolled out of bed and ran to station as opposed to those who got up at 3am to get ready for work!!
@_greggor have you seen the Adlam tweet about potential BBC radio Cambs work placement in summer!!!
3.63 miles tonight in 29 minutes 20 secs.....just over 8 min mile pace......really pleased with that #epic #buzzin

This guy Nev in the Call Centre is brilliant, but I&#39;m not sure how he gets away with the comments, clearly he has HR locked in a cupboard
@BlackBerryHelp could someone tell me if the Twitter app has gone down again on the z10 as it defaults to a sign in page and hangs!!

Has pulled a muscle in his back, bloody agony, ibuprofen not working, need the pain threshold of a woman and what&#39;s more no running!!
@twiggydoll @_greggor is it fathers day soon?
Can I offer advice...Deep Heat rubbed in after a hot bath is not really a good idea!
Has arrived at the Orbital Premier Inn at Cannock with Lyn the night before her East Region debut weekend
So disappointed that here I am in the Premier Inn Cannock and no sign of Lennie Henry
Now I can hear a train, oh no its the Euston to Manchester main line now 50 yards away, deep joy
Breakfast in Cannock two from one of the other teams  here, the ladies play for Combined Services,looks like Danny Dyer and Jason Statham
@CLP07 oh dear, what sort of say would that be Pateman.....i have ears :)
So a busy week, Leicester today...what a jewel!!!
Sad news about Sir Henry Cecil, another great person to lose to the big C. But at least he left us with the legacy that was Frankel!!

Naproxin and Cocodemol not really working, feel like an addict need something stronger as this is bloody painful
In the words of the Verve..the drugs don&#39;t work. Can only walk about 100 yards before I have to stop as my quad is destroyed by pain #update
At the Werrington Dental practice with Rachel Sullivan also #familyouting
So it&#39;s been a week now...the sciatica trapped nerve problem shows no sign of going away. Drugs must be working but they don&#39;t remove pain
3 types of drugs now and a further week to see how things go!!. Frustrating, annoying and it gets you down
Once again football showing what we in England without doubt have the best 3rd team on any pitch. Webb, Mullarky and Cann excellent

2nd set of physio tonight. If it&#39;s as successful as Monday then I could be 50% better.....lets bloody hope so
The famous cinnamon chicken dish tonight cooked by @_Greggor
@twiggydoll why cape town?
Waiting in the O2 shop whilst the guru is on a fag break. I guess that&#39;s customer service these days. I&#39;m waiting while you serve yourself!

It&#39;s so hot my finger is struggling to get up and tweet
Visit no 5 to Physio tonight....desired outcome would be less pain!
Best nights sleep for weeks, until lyn shouted the fire alarm was going, for around 0.7 secs!!
Why did the fire alarm go off I blame it on all the windows being open and a fire fly popping in the Windows and landing on it
We&#39;ve been in fat face for nearly 40 mins now, good job they have a chair.....no tea or coffee though!!
@twiggydoll lyn!
