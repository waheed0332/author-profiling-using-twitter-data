@hedgefundinvest Worse than this is when certain Rabbis attempt to cover up sexual abuse. See @FailedMessiah at http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/&nbsp;

@TheHarper @hedgefundinvest No excuse for violence under any circumstances. Rabbi Epstein is a monster!
Memo to Mendel Epstein: You may dress up as a Rabbi, but you are not a real Rabbi. No place for evil in Judaism.http://nyp.st/1aqfuAB&nbsp;

Tip for Fraudsters: Investors will trust you implicitly if you have never been convicted of a crime.
Memo to @muddywatersre: Thank u for giving $NQ credit for using the Crazy Eddie playbook in handling auditors. I love crooks who emulate me
@muddywatersre Thank you! I doubt I would&#39;ve stood a chance against sleuths like you back in my criminal days at Crazy Eddie.
@RMoney If Eric Holder were Attorney General during the 1980s, I&#39;d still be fleecing investors at Crazy Eddie today.
@Maidenlaneiii It&#39;s at the safehouse :-)
Tip for Fraudsters: Every dip in the market value of your stock creates a &quot;buying opportunity&quot; to lure in more suckers.

Memo to @Carl_C_Icahn: In every plaque put up to honor your name should be your support of multi-level marketing scams like Herbalife. $HLF
@JeffMayer7 @Carl_C_Icahn My plaque would say that I sold false hope to Crazy Eddie&#39;s victims like the management team running $HLF.
Memo to European Prime Ministers: Don&#39;t worry about the NSA spying on you. Such news will help you win elections.
@virtualcfo It was the cops trying to find me, so I was unable to do the next segment because I had to leave the studio in a hurry. :-)
@williambanzai7 Suggest u do campaign posters for European Heads of State saying &quot;I was formidable enough to be spied on by the NSA.&quot;
Crazy Eddie Memoirs: I am insulted that the NSA didn&#39;t spy on me. All I got was FBI agents and US Marshals tailing me.
Tip for Fraudsters: If you want to be &quot;respectable&quot; crooks, run a multi-level marketing company and get @Carl_C_Icahn to invest in you.
@freegolds It got really tough when the FBI and US Marshals followed me into the men&#39;s room at the Newark Federal Courthouse.
@johnrock4 @freegolds Crazy Eddie moved HQ to NJ in 1986.

The white-collar criminals on Wall Street have Eric Holder while the blue-collar criminals on NYC&#39;s other streets have Bill de Blasio.
@Dilfre Making me drink Herbalife shakes would be cruel and unusual punishment. Forcing me to drink it on a cruise ship would be torture.
Memo to Eric Holder: Suggest you amend SAC agreement to force Steve Cohen to live on eating Herbalife products for 1 month. $HLF
@Dilfre Sorry, but drinking Herbalife shakes doesn&#39;t make most of its distributors smart enough to make money. $HLF
@ElCabronMalo @jeffmayer If as you say, my memos regarding $HLF are stupid, why are you stupid enough to read them and comment on them?
@Dilfre If that&#39;s the case, $HLF can eliminate the MLM model.

@deeCNBC @muddywatersre Deirdre: Why didn&#39;t you ask $NQ to release the names of the audit engagement partner and his/her team? (To be fair)
@deeCNBC @muddywatersre Deirdre: The big accounting firms don&#39;t like proposals to make engagement partners put their names on reports.
@MUNDASPORTS Zero
Memo to $NQ: Every fraudster cites clean audit opinions.
Memo to $NQ: Back in my criminal days at Crazy Eddie, our accountants issued clean audit reports every time. Fooling auditors is easy.
To Taek-Geun Kwon: Purpose of securities fraud is to make stocks go higher. So why would a rising stock price mean there is no fraud? $NQ
@MUNDASPORTS Tell the FBI to investigate me. They already have my mugshot and fingerprints on file.
@dschorrnyc I don&#39;t get your point
@dschorrnyc He made a certain point about Muddy Waters being wrong on past calls
@BarbarianCap Obtaining a clean audit opinion doesn&#39;t count for street creds among fraudsters any more, because it&#39;s too easy.
@dschorrnyc I agree with you. Never give anyone blind trust, whether long or short.
@dschorrnyc a 333 average is enough to be a superstar, at least in baseball :-)

@vrstocktrader @StockPicker10 Don&#39;t get too upset. That was the nicest thing I said about big 4 accounting firms all week. $NQ
@BarbarianCap The SEC should require CFOs to pass math proficiency test. The PCAOB should do the same with auditors.

#FF @KPMG for believing that I was not crook while I was cooking the books at Crazy Eddie.
Memo to $NQ: At Crazy Eddie, we reported inflated cash balances because the auditors did not bother to look at how the cash got there.
Tip for Investors: Big 4 audit firms are not hired for their competency. They are hired for their apathy to fraud and accounting trickery.
Memo to $NQ: The best way to marginalize your critics is to ignore them, but please don&#39;t follow my advice and carry on.
Memo to $EBIX: Carefully check all legal invoices. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if your lawyer&#39;s accounting is more crooked than yours.

@MUNDASPORTS One more thing. KPMG did not resign as auditors for Crazy Eddie. They were fired by new mgmt who won control in a proxy fight.
@Carson_Block $NQ probably loves nitwits like you who make erroneous assumptions with no due diligence. I got house arrest, not prison.
@Carson_Block Poor choice of a comeback line, but you like most nitwits don&#39;t get your facts straight, but feel free to rant on.
Memo to Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft LLP: You had no clue to full extent of Crazy Eddie fraud until you came to me for help. $NQ
@JoseANunez1 @perrone_ken The purpose of securities fraud is to increase the stock price, so you are not making any point re $NQ

@dschorrnyc Correct that I&#39;m in fraud teaching biz. That&#39;s why I follow $NQ &amp; others, especially when parallels to Crazy Eddie are involved

@ansgarjohn I was forcibly retired from white-collar crime due to the heroic efforts of the FBI and SEC.
@ansgarjohn $EBIX has many red flags. I suspect possible fraud. Suggest you read @GothamResearch reports.

To Preet Bharara: Fining wrongdoing with no incarceration is a tax on crime with no punishment. It makes u a tax collector, not a prosecutor
Memo to Preet Bharara: The message you are sending is that white-collar crime is OK, so long as you can afford to pay the fines.
Tip for Fraudsters: Steal enough money so you can pay the fines and you won&#39;t go to jail with Eric Holder running the Dept of Justice.

@mtaibbi @LindaAlmonte The longer the wait for a deposition, the less the witness will recall.
@aenbrnood @mtaibbi @LindaAlmonte Won&#39;t happen with DOJ run by Eric Holder. I mugger has a better chance of getting indicted.
Tip for Fraudsters: DOJ policy under Eric Holder - Steal big, pay a relatively small fine. Steal small, go to jail.
@stacyherbert $JPM paid a fraud tax, nothing more, nothing less. DOJ is the new IRS. Taxing fraud in the form of fines without punishment.
Memo to Cousin Crazy Eddie Antar: Today, you probably would&#39;ve been able to cut the Feds a check and avoid 8 years in prison.

Memo to Voters: It would make my day if Attorney General Eric Holder ran for President on a &quot;Law and Order&quot; platform.

Memo to Jamie Dimon: What&#39;s $13 billion in fines when you have over $200 billion in shareholders&#39; equity? - Pocket change. $JPM
Memo to Jamie Dimon: Investors will reward JPMorgan for paying the fine and putting most of its problems behind it. Crime pays. $JPM
Memo to Imprisoned Mafia Bosses: If you ran a Wall Street bank, you could have avoided prison.
Memo to Eric Holder: I have no doubt that at best you will find some mid-level executive to indict for the crimes of his bosses on Wall St.

@MKerryFuller It&#39;s easy. Put me on ignore.
Memo to Investors: If a corporation is a legal person, some of them need treatment for mental illness.
Memo to Questcor Pharmaceuticals: People don&#39;t have a legal duty to like you. In fact, questioning your actions is patriotic. $QCOR

@MKerryFuller I&#39;ll take up your suggestion at the next conspiracy meeting (sarcasm).
@MKerryFuller It&#39;s a vast conspiracy. No room for new conspirators. Just kidding. You&#39;re good with me :-)

The great thing about flying to West Palm Beach is that over 95% of the people on the plane are still older than me. Makes me feel young.
@AlderLaneeggs @herbgreenberg @YianniNYC Respectfully disagree. The shorts are a convenient scapegoat to blame.
@moorehn @EmilyGould My Godfather Vito Corleone taught me to be nicer to my enemies than my friends.
@Maidenlaneiii @moorehn @EmilyGould Going to teach the Los Angeles audience how professional crooks fake it :-)
@EmilyGould If his son Sonny followed his father&#39;s footsteps it would have worked out well for Vito.
@EmilyGould Sonny Corleone was too emotional
@AlderLaneeggs @firstadopter They built lies upon lies and ran out of room to explain the numbers.
@AlderLaneeggs @firstadopter He&#39;s crossed over from enabler to co-conspirator

Any head hunter who is stupid enough to contact me without knowing I am a felon deserves to have his head handed to him.
Memo to Head Hunters: Before we talk about any opportunities, can you please Google me and call me back?
@BarbarianCap Those companies in Utah and Vermont only hire crooks who can&#39;t add. My phony numbers always tied in.
@coffeygrinds these are for white collar jobs where felons don&#39;t qualify
