I refer to #Lions head coach Jim Schwartz as &quot;gym shorts&quot; during conversations since it amuses me. I am such a child. #NFL
Which uniforms are uglier? Oregon or Oregon State&#39;s? I wanted to blind myself after I turned this game on.
This Oregon/Oregon State game is a back-and-forth fight. Whoever has the ball last is probably going to win at this rate.
Oregon pulls ahead with 30 seconds left in the game. Boom.
#Twins sign Ricky Nolasco to 4-year deal. They should have inked Bronson Arroyo for 3 years. Phil Hughes will get looks now. #MLB
@dwcash159 In the words of Maury: &quot;The lie detector test determined that was a lie.&quot; He indirectly asked for it on behalf of his agent.
I&#39;m looking forward to the Iron Bowl. Auburn has a chance to knock Bama from the SEC &#39;ship game. OSU/Mich always good too. My personal fav.
#Yankees pushing Cano to sign sooner rather than later. If I&#39;m Cano, I&#39;m staying on market until Christmas time. All the leverage he has.
There shouldn&#39;t be any urgency on Cano&#39;s end, at this moment. #yankees #mlb
#Yankees need to address that outfield &amp; add depth at middle infield + third base. Oh yeah, another starting pitcher or three would be nice.
So Duke FOOTBALL is a win away from an ACC &#39;ship game appearance. If someone told me an apocalypse was about to happen, I&#39;d believe them.
The good life. &quot;@ddockett: I&#39;m just chillin in my hotel room in Philly , drinking hot tea, watching college football. Listening to Sade&quot;
@alicia_terbecki lol yeah. Like Brian McCann.  I can&#39;t wait for him to be a full-time DH in a few years.
Texas A&amp;M locks up Kevin Sumlin to a 6-year deal. A lot of people forget that the #Eagles offered him the head coach job before Chip Kelly.
Wow. Ohio State will escape Ann Arbor with a win. Great game.
Brady Hoke made the right call going for two despite it failing. Michigan wasn&#39;t stopping OSU anyway so go for the outright win.
Michigan didn&#39;t have much to play for other than spoiling OSU&#39;s national &#39;ship hopes... which they tried to just do.
@_CUTigers exactly my thoughts. I was telling Auron that.
And just like that, Alabama pulls ahead on a 99-yard touchdown.
WR was wide open. McCarron&#39;s throw was a floater... actually under thrown.
I sound like such a hater...
Auburn has a fourth down stop of their own now. Down by 7 with the ball. About 5:30 to go.
Hell&#39;uva Iron Bowl we have going on.
That was some Harlem Globetrotter shit Nick Marshall just pulled. #Auburn ties it up against #Alabama 28-28.
Absolutely hated going for that 57 yard field goal.  Allowed Auburn to return a kick and now look what happened.  Should have thrown it up.
What a game. What a finish. Auburn beats Alabama.
Bad move by Saban. I still think McCarron should have been given a chance to throw it up. Special teams has been a shitshow all night.
Auburn just broke the Internet.
Hopefully Ohio State and Florida State win their conference championship games. No more Alabama pretty please.
If Mike Tomlin was coaching Alabama, he would have so &quot;ran into&quot; Chris Davis there.
Imagine if Brady Hoke&#39;s call to go for 2 points was successful against Ohio State earlier? The BCS would have been a clusterfuck.

I respect Auburn and Mizzou for what they&#39;ve done this season after last. But this SEC &#39;ship game is very unappealing to the casual fan.
Alabama kicker Cade Foster has &quot;blacked out&quot; his twitter account. No pic or profile header.
Phil Hughes signs with the #Twins at the tune of 3 years for $24 million. Not bad after a dismal year in the Bronx... #mlb #yankees
I hope they all get tested for PEDs. RT @espn: Last year, Mizzou didn&#39;t make a bowl game. This year, they’re SEC Championship bound.
I have a feeling Bama gets a BCS bowl since the SEC &#39;ship game loser will get hosed and miss out. Sort of like Florida over Georgia last yr.
@AaronCornielle Time will tell. Cano isn&#39;t signing anywhere anytime soon (my guess) anyway.
Great Saturday in college football. Throw out all the records because it&#39;s almost like a sibling rivalry instead.
@AaronCornielle it&#39;s also the same reason Cano&#39;s reported demands are high. Give this another month to marinate and we&#39;ll see what happens.
@AaronCornielle lol man, now your tweets need to be reviewed. SMH.
Learning this more and more as I get older. RT @ShaineDawson: Never take time/people for granted
@DanielSoden Shocking and ironic.
Still trying to wrap my mind around what happened in college football today. Pretty anxious to see the polls tomorrow.
My guess: 1.FSU, 2.tOSU, 3.Auburn 4.Mizzou, 5.Bama. Good chance Auburn leapfrogs tOSU after such a big win after tOSU just escaped Ann Arbor
B1G and ACC just aren&#39;t as good as the SEC. BCS poll takes that into account.

#Giants offseason priority number-one: REBUILD THE OFFENSIVE LINE. Beatty and Pugh are the only guys who should be set to return. #nfl
William Beatty is having a bad night, but he&#39;s locked into his new deal. He&#39;s not going anywhere anytime soon. #nfl #giants #nyg
Pugh is the Swiss army knife. Can also play guard if needed.  #nfl #nyg #giants
Boothe will hit free agency again. Baas should be cut due to injuries and ineffectiveness. I love Snee but retirement may be his option.
@DanielSoden I like Beatty. He&#39;s still relatively young. I&#39;m not suggesting it was a mistake re-signing him (which I&#39;m sure you perceived)
@xdivyax13 Beatty is locked in for 5 years. #Giants would take major salary cap hits if they somehow cut him. Not going anywhere.
I&#39;ll always appreciate Diehl and his versatility but it&#39;s tired some watching d-lineman run right around him now. #nfl #giants #nyg
@xdivyax13 Boothe was a restricted free agent last yr anyway so signing him long-term didn&#39;t make sense at the time.
@DanielSoden Right. Beatty was never really a regular cog on the o-line until last year. Before he struggled with injuries.
@xdivyax13 Instead they brought Boothe back on a 1-yr deal to prove himself again. #Giants had leverage. Boothe hasn&#39;t lived up.

New York #Giants safety Antrel Rolle on not making the Pro Bowl http://tmblr.co/ZkExrv12UMmFu&nbsp; #NFL @SportsBlogRT @SportsTalkRT @BlogsUnite
@Ernso_JB Yeah Rolle is really the only deserving Giant. I thought he&#39;d get in. Tuck has an argument but Rolle should have been a definite.
@antrelrolle26 Regardless of this Mickey Mouse Pro Bowl voting process, you&#39;re an MVP to #Giants fans.
BEAT NOTRE DAME
Bill O&#39;Brien is working on a deal with the #Texans per ESPN. F that... stay at Penn State rather than go to Texas&#39;s #2 #NFL team.
O&#39;Brien has to be making a good amount of change at PSU. Why set yourself up for failure with a second-rate #NFL franchise? Stay at PSU.
Same thing with Brian Kelly. I&#39;d much rather coach Notre Dame than a #Lions franchise. #nfl

College Football Bowl Season Part III-#NFL Hopefuls to Watch http://tmblr.co/ZkExrv12ljU6d&nbsp; #NFL @SportsBlogRT @gamefacelee @SportsTalkRT
Kevin Gilbride should have been fired long ago. Tom Coughlin is very loyal to his staff. Hopefully Mike Sullivan can come back. #giants #nfl
The #Giants offense, which was supposed to be the strength of the team, has clearly regressed. Starts up front -- o-line needs to be rebuilt
Need some running backs. David Wilson cannot be relied upon since he may face neck surgery. Andre Brown is a F/A. #nfl #giants
Successful teams always had a solid running game. While Gilbride was always willing to run, the pieces haven&#39;t been there. #nfl #giants
It&#39;s a near-mess right now. Everyone is at fault. John Mara even admitted that the team over-valued some people/players. #nfl #giants
Going to be interesting to see how hard the #Giants go in retaining Justin Tuck and Hakeem Nicks. I&#39;m sure both will get offers. #nfl
Eli Manning and Antrel Rolle should receive extensions so the #Giants can take less of a cap-hit from both players for 2014 and beyond. #nfl
@DanielSoden Definitely possible. He&#39;s not going to get big $ from #Giants. Plus, Randle and Jernigan have earned some more playing-time.
@xdivyax13 I think the same about Nicks. #Giants have more WR-depth to fall back on. Randle and Jernigan had their moments.
@DanielSoden @therealestjmac Agreed. There will be someone to overpay for Nicks considering his age. At times, he did look dominant.
@aymish1 @sloppyEli These strains are brilliant BTW. I&#39;m literally lol&#39;ing here.
I actually think retaining Rex Ryan was the right move for #Jets. Players still love and play hard for him. #nfl
Ryan has been one of the better coaches for the #Jets in a while. Defensive guru. Still gives #Patriots fits despite no offensive talent.
@xdivyax13 Oh yeah that&#39;s definitely a good move (to bring in a vet). They had Murphy this year but he couldn&#39;t make it on the field.
@xdivyax13 Yeah special teams has been a disaster this year. Can always count on the #Giants to not return one for a touchdown too.
@xdivyax13 I think so... in 2007 lol
