Watching the news: &quot;you will wake up to 4 below zero and 20-30 below windchills.&quot; #omg
@LauraTroyani so what are your predictions for the steelers today? :)
@LauraTroyani Haha, I like your thinking. Will be watching with my dad today - he has his #Steelers gear on!
Nice to see the @vikings win for the last game in the Metrodome! #RIPMetrodome #minnesota
Let&#39;s go @Seahawks!!!! #gohawks
@LauraTroyani I can&#39;t believe how close Steelers are to making the playoffs! #fingerscrossed
Haha Rams, you should just give up now. #gohawks
I&#39;d be embarrassed to be Rams fan right now...&quot;Verbal abuse of an official&quot; lol #gohawks
@NykolleB this game is so amusing!
And steelers fans everywhere are in disbelief...
