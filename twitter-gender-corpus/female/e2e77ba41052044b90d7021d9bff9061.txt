Embrace #REST. Take 1 day a month for 100% rest. No compromises, watches, phones, work, computers. Be in silence with yourself. #NHTa9
UNPLUG TO RECHARGE:  Set aside 30-60 min before bed to completely escape stimulation, technology, indoor lighting. #NHTa9 #sleep
&quot;The only way to keep your #health is to eat what you don&#39;t want, drink what you don&#39;t like, and do what you&#39;d rather not.&quot; -Mark Twain

The road to success is dotted with many tempting parking places.
FOCUS MONDAY: We MUST #focus on ONE thing at a time. Roman&#39;s knew this with their proverb; &quot;The man who chases TWO rabbits catches none.&quot;
EAT YOUR FROG first thing in the morning!  http://bit.ly/rcSj1i&nbsp;   #success
NO &quot;PROCRASTINATION&quot; MONDAY:  A wise man does in the BEGINNING, what a fool does in the end.   Commit &amp; DO NOW something you&#39;ve postponed.
Running Late?  a) admit your mistake b) be #honest   http://bit.ly/qS3ZuW&nbsp;   c) plan better.  #punctuality
IMPECCABLE FOCUS: If you are facing the right direction, all you have to do is keep on walking in order to reach your #dreams.
The whole world steps ASIDE for the man who knows where he&#39;s going.  Pick 1 goal today that you have previously avoided. DO IT NOW. :)
Yes...I was serious.  &quot;That thing&quot; you just thought of doing and then blew off completely.... DO IT!!!!  STOP what you are doing, and DO IT!
IMPECCABILITY includes our physical bodies, minds, intentions, beliefs &amp; values. At 9am &amp; 9pm I&#39;ll share Nutrition &amp; Health Tips #NHTa9
Start a #Gratitude Journal for the little things you observe gratitude for each day. It&#39;ll be a GREAT read one day! #gratitude #NHTa9

INTEREST vs COMMITMENT: Business procrastination occurs from a lack of COMMITMENT.
KILL PROCRASTINATION WITH COMMITMENT!  Do you want your love partner &quot;interested&quot; or &quot;committed&quot;? COMMIT to something you&#39;ve been avoiding.
REMINDER: Just interrupting your day to remind you of any Halloween errands for tonight!
DON&#39;T FORGET CANDY!!!!

Be curious.  Look things up! Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anybody else, that&#39;s how you&#39;ll get ahead.
Google everything. I mean EVERYTHING. Google #dreams , #Google problems. You&#39;ll find the answer or you&#39;ll come up with a better question!
SCHOOL YOURSELF. School is one thing. Education is another. The two don&#39;t always overlap. It&#39;s your responsibility to #educate yourself.

@FunnyEvil what does that make you? Adventurous? ;)


Be curious.  Look things up! Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anybody else, that&#39;s how you&#39;ll get ahead.
Google everything. I mean EVERYTHING. Google #dreams , #Google problems. You&#39;ll find the answer or you&#39;ll come up with a better question!
SCHOOL YOURSELF. School is one thing. Education is another. The two don&#39;t always overlap. It&#39;s your responsibility to #educate yourself.
