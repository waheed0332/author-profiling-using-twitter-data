@ramseyshow Is there a rule of thumb guideline for a percentage of income that is appropriate to spend on a wedding?
@chrisbrogan You&#39;re right, they are not as many magazines as they are people constantly pitching books and articles.
@PamMktgNut What kind of social spam bothers you the most?  I don&#39;t like invitations to events on FB that are totally not relevant to me.
@PamMktgNut I agree, makes it hard to weed through the junk to find the real conversations.

@MoneyMatters :)  I say that too...way too often, but I&#39;m not about to get one of those old lady chains to keep them around my neck!
@VisitFlagstaff Yes we absolutely would!  This is the second year we&#39;ve done this and it was very fun.  Can&#39;t wait to go back!

Any dentists in the house? I&#39;m working on an article for @bargainbabe and I need an expert opinion.
@newbalance I&#39;m doing my first 5K at #blogher13. Trying to find shoes for my high arch/wide feet. My 850&#39;s feel too stiff. Any suggestions?
@carriebaughcum @simplecitylife @RubberChickenMa I did .5 in am, .5 at lunch, 1.5 at night and quit because it was getting too dark.
@carriebaughcum Thanks, I am!
@simplecitylife @RubberChickenMa @carriebaughcum I&#39;m really looking forward to it. :)  Got to find new shoes soon, though!!!
@dragonflytweet @carriebaughcum @simplecitylife @RubberChickenMa Will work up to that Kristi! Still babying my knee, also need shoes &amp; bra!
@dragonflytweet Great, thanks so much! How&#39;s your foot doing?
@dragonflytweet I&#39;m so sorry to hear that, Kristi. :(  It&#39;s good you&#39;re taking care of it though.  Don&#39;t want to make it worse.
@dragonflytweet You&#39;ll do great, I&#39;m sure!  I will be walking most (all) of #BlogHer13 5K.
