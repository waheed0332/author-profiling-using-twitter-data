Design of user experience is just as important, if not more, as visual design. Design will go even further in future via @marissamayer #df13

&quot;#gamification is a marmite term: you either love it or hate it.&quot; #DF13
Can&#39;t agree more w/ Rajat: #gamification is about &quot;what&#39;s in it for me&quot; That&#39;s the first thing I ask in all the field-facing work I do #df13
10 years from now #gamification will be a standard part of design, it&#39;s what will make winners in market. It&#39;s human behavior. #df13

We need to be where our customers are--what sources are useful for them and they have trust. They can lock you out. #socialselling #df13
Social capital: you&#39;re not selling product; you&#39;re selling yourself. Listen 1st--Earn right to be in convo &amp; add value. #socialselling #DF13
Leverage your social brand to find right ppl #socialselling 1) who do I talk to? 2) what do I say? 3) how am I connected, how bridge? #DF13
Start w/ 5 min a day on social. Develop expertise in what your customers are interested in--doesn&#39;t have to be product. #socialselling #DF13
Totally agree: in #socialselling font-line manager involvement is key, so they can coach teams. Also need advocate from field. #df13
Cold calling is dead. If you&#39;re buying lists, you&#39;re wasting $ and capital soft calling--white paper DLs, social leads. #socialselling #df13
