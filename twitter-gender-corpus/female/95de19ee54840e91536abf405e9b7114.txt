i love ramsey but the show gets a little over-the-top. why is there ALWAYS a tie in each challenge, then go to commercial? #hellskitchen

@OnceABC after all she&#39;s been put through, Snow was finally pushed to her breaking point #byebyeCora
@OnceABC it&#39;s sucks because before Cora showed up, Regina was starting to change #DarkSnow
@HellsKitchenFOX where the heck has JP been all this time? he just shows up out of the blue with no explanation ... ? #hellskitchen

@tvland Just got home from work in time to see Blanche handle menopause. I still wanna be her when I&#39;m old ;) #TheGoldenGirls
@tvland How much do I love #TheGoldenGirls ? So much, that I&#39;m ignoring new episodes of my usual Monday night shows to watch #TVLandRocks
I wanna know, how many people sing along with the opening theme every time? I do! #TheGoldenGirls #thankyouforbeingafriend
@tvland OMG, Rose&#39;s reaction to Clayton&#39;s &quot;confession&quot;. Lol #TheGoldenGirls

Time for #Scandal !!
@ScandalABC I like Quinn and Huck&#39;s working relationship. Huck has really taken her under his wing. #Scandal
@TheKateBurton I love that you&#39;re on this show! #Scandal
@tonygoldwyn Good guy. Bad guy. You&#39;re great at playing either. #Scandal
@TheKateBurton We haven&#39;t heard from the VP in a while, does she have any more tricks up her sleeve? #AskScandal
@ScandalABC Call me a skeptic but even though her ear was cut off, something still seems fishy with her #scandal
Yes, Huck! Keep digging! The kidnapping is fake! I knew it!! #scandal
Cut off my ear for 20 million dollars? Sure, why not? #scandal
@RoannaDee76 I knew we are Scandal experts at this point
@ScandalABC Never thought I&#39;d say this but I feel sorry for Hollis #scandal
@ScandalABC OMG! What just happened???!!!!! #Mole #scandal
Just when we think we have it figured out, we get thrown another curve all. Well done #Scandal #WhoIsTheMole
It&#39;s Good Friday. I&#39;ll be at service to tonight after work #GoodFriday

@LeslieCromwell Dude, tweet something
@tvland Wow, I actually remember watching this #GoldenGirls episode with Bob Hope when it first aired
I love watching reruns of 30 Rock every night. I miss that show. :-( #30rock
@nbc30rock As you know, my single, &quot;My Single Is Dropping,&quot; is dropping.
Parties are like Frisbees. If you throw them the wrong way they&#39;ll veer off in a bad direction then your kid will fall into a quarry #30rock
What&#39;s the past for scammed? Is it scrumped? Liz Lemon, you just got scrumped #30rock
Watching my favorite group of gals #TheGoldenGirls #TVLand
Is it wrong that I want to be Blanche when I&#39;m older? #TheGoldenGirls #TVLand
@LogoTV awesome that you and @tvland are showing #TheGoldenGirls
Didn&#39;t realize @Pharrell was gonna be on Daft Punk&#39;s new album. Now I definitely have to buy it. #randomaccessmemories
@RadclyffeBSB Loved The Lone Hunt, been reading the series from the start. I&#39;d love a story just about Michel and Katya ending up together!
My heart is broken. #bostonmarathon
@MelBarWright And also with you
&quot;Oh gold shoes? My nephew just joined the Marines to try to pay for college but ... that&#39;s fun.&quot; #30rock
&quot;And that remark of &#39;An Affair to Remember&#39; that I was in? &#39;A Blaffair to Rememblack.&#39;&quot; Tracy Jordan #30rock
&quot;Shut it down!&quot; #30rock
Ok so today wasn&#39;t a bad day but it wasn&#39;t a great day. Everyone seemed to be out to get me stressed or drive me crazy. But I&#39;m home now.
Ken: I&#39;m signing up people for the TGS softball team. So far I have 8 &quot;No&quot;s &amp; 25 &quot;Shove-It-Up-Your-Goon-hole&quot;s  #30rock

My favorite night of the week! #onceuponatime #OUAT
@StartupBros Thanks for the follow. Your website looks great, can&#39;t wait to check it out.
Sunday night! Time for me to continue my on-going crush on Regina aka @LanaParrilla ;) #OnceUponATime #OUAT
Another Regina and Snow White showdown #EvilRegal #OUAT
Has Regina been out-villianed? #EvilRegal #OUAT
I&#39;ve wanted to be a singer ever since I was a little ... drunk the other day and rented studio space #30rock
@tvland Look at Lou, he&#39;s got game #ForeverYoung
@ABCSharkTank the squirrel zapper is a terrible product but at least the sharks seemed to have fun playing with it
@kevinolearytv yes the zapper was a terrible idea and you were the only one smart enough to not be zapped #MrWonderful
@kevinolearytv Wow, he actually told you, you&#39;re wrong. He&#39;s out. #MrWonderful
@kevinolearytv you&#39;re the okra in her gumbo! Lol!
@ABCSharkTank Somebody invest in the gumbo blocks!!!
@kevinolearytv @LoriGreiner Wow!! You all are amazing! You are changing this woman&#39;s life! Kevin really is Mr Wonderful #sharktank
@gumbogeek Congratulations on making a deal with the sharks!!! God Bless you, your family, and your business!
Ok, phone is turned off. Do not disturb for the next hour. It&#39;s that magical time #onceuponatime #OUAT

@RoannaDee76 wasn&#39;t he the former aide to the VP?
Those burgers look delicious. The sharks always get fed. #sharktank
@ABCSharkTank @getglue I thought it had wheels but no pedals
@HappyEndingsABC I cant believe I wont get to see any more new episodes. This was such a great show with very talented writers #happyendings
Season 2 finale! I&#39;m on the edge of my seat!! #OnceUponATime #OUAT
And this is why I love Regina #OnceUponATime
You are the best! @LanaParrilla #OnceUponATime
It&#39;s going to be a long summer ... :( #OnceUponATime

@thereverendmom lol
Watching @theofficenbc finale! #thatswhatshesaid
@theofficenbc I&#39;ve seen every episode. It&#39;s a bittersweet ending #theofficefinale
Yes, I&#39;m unfollowing people. Nothing personal but the constant spam and retweets are driving me crazy.
The Dinner Party is my absolute favorite episode. #theofficefinale
Wow, Joan Cusack on @theofficenbc ! #theofficefinale
That&#39;s what she said! #theofficefinale
I wish there was a way to know you&#39;re in the good ol days before you leave them. - Andy Bernard #theofficefinale

Great word - &quot;scumbagery&quot; #AmericanGreedChat
I wish I could have @StacyKeach1 record my voicemail greeting or even better, follow me around and narrate my life #AmericanGreedChat
Trevor Cook is the very definition of #scumbagery but that mansion was something else entirely #AmericanGreedChat
Another great episode, can&#39;t wait for next week! @AmericanGreedTV @StacyKeach1 #AmericanGreedChat
@LogoTV Love the Golden Girls reruns!
@tvland &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; reruns? Greatness!
This is way funnier then the one they air. #havertyslady http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaWFMTQQ6o&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player&nbsp;…
@MiaPleasant_ Yeah, hi, it seems like you&#39;ve copied my account. Any explanations?
It&#39;s only the beginning of June and I&#39;m already ready for summer to be over.
I would rather have reruns of my favorite shows during the summer rather than some of the crappy summer shows the networks feature.
Now that #30rock and #theoffice are off the air, there&#39;s hardly anything to watch on NBC
Oh oh oooh, oh oh ohh, oh oh oooh, the right stuff! #nkotb
@LogoTV I can never get enough #goldengirlsufc Best way to end a long work day #IWantToBeBlancheWhenIGetOlder
In five years, we&#39;ll either be working for him or be dead by his hand #30rock
Why do I pay for #netflix and it&#39;s not working?! I&#39;d like to sit down and watch some movies. Maybe I should cancel and get #huluplus
Gonna fly now! Won&#39;t be long now!

@RadclyffeBSB Will Lonely Hearts Club ever get a sequel? I know Liz &amp; Reilly had theirs in In Deep Waters 2. But what about Bren &amp; Jae?
@RadclyffeBSB maybe? your stories have such great character development, we want them all to have a happy ending, don&#39;t leave us hanging lol
Watching America&#39;s Got Talent #AGTSeason6

DOMA Arigato!!!! #doma
@AmericanGreedTV An all new episode? I&#39;m there. BRING ON THE GREED! #iloveamericangreed
Ok, this is gonna sound weird but I want more episodes that feature women as the scam artists #GreedChat
@LJMercedes hey I said it was gonna sound weird! No judgement lol!
First of all this guy was way into the Confederacy. Second, ponzi scheme wasnt necessary if he had actually bought the silver #GreedChat
@LJMercedes hahaha!
@TiffanyChampion exactly! It was a genuinely good investment idea and all of his investors would have made actual money &amp; kept investing
USA! USA! USA!
Blerg ... #30rock

@LanaParrilla Happy Birthday to the best and hottest TV villian that ever was.
Hey baby, what&#39;s wrong? #30rock
@RollingStone Tsarnaev is all over the media &amp; you all turned him into a rock star with your cover. What about the victims? Feature them!
@SyfyMovies Just when I thought you couldn&#39;t beat Sharktopus, Dinoshark, Crocosaurus, and all the others, here comes #SharkNado !!

@thereverendmom @whichwich I was not invited *pouts*
@thereverendmom I&#39;m in Mansfield now
@thereverendmom are you guys just eating your way through the Highlands?
I will miss waking up to your show. #ripkiddkraddick
@AmericanGreedTV Awesome! I missed it on Thursday. I&#39;m getting ready to watch it now
I love this episode of Martin with the white girl named Aquanetta LOL #Martin #TVOne
My prediction for #arielcastro - judge will give him 3 life sentences to be served consecutively but he&#39;ll get shanked his 1st night in
1000 years without parole, great job Ohio! That gives him ALOT of time to think about what he did to those women. #arielcastro
Ohio has got better prosecuters and a better justice system than Florida #arielcastro
Judge Russo is my new hero! #arielcastro
Another one? Yes! A twofer! Well done, Greed. #AmericanGreed
200 million dollars worth of wine??!! Give him The Chair! #AmericanGreed
He can have 27 years of toilet wine in prison #AmericanGreed
Thank God it&#39;s Friday. Three more hours and I&#39;m home free! #TGIF
FYI, everyone that tries to &quot;sell&quot; me twitter followers is getting unfollowed
Right Wing nut jobs are also being unfollowed. Everyone has right to express their own opinion, just not on my twitter feed
Watching #BeyondScaredStraight  I love this show. #AETV
I love the follow up with the kids after they do the program. Seems to have a high success rate #BeyondScaredStraight #AETV
@rezaaslan I grew up Christian &amp; I cant wait to read your book. Fox News doesnt understand anything about anyone that doesnt think like them
@rezaaslan If she had even bothered to read your book, the interview would&#39;ve been informative, your credentials spoke for themselves
Well, Monday, we meet again ...
@wobarlington I&#39;m enjoying my first time here. I had Maredous 8 and Chimey Cinq Cents. The wait staff is nice.
Watching #HouseofCards on #Netflix I know I&#39;m late but this is a great show
Halfway through #HouseOfCards I&#39;m going to make a whole Saturday out of this!
RIP Lee Thompson Young, I pray your soul is at peace. #RIPLeeThompsonYoung #RIPJettJackson
Yeah and so far, no one I know is happy about Ben Affleck announced as the next Batman
Wasn&#39;t the Batman franchise bad enough with casting George Clooney?  Ben Affleck is such a bad idea. He&#39;s better at directing anyway
That&#39;s a deal breaker, ladies! #30rock
&quot;You take a hotdog, stuff it with some jack cheese, fold it in a pizza - you got cheesy blasters!&quot; #cheesyblasters #30RockRerurns

David Alan Grier on Martin, playing Rev, Leon Lonny Love. He was a such a slimy character lol
Looking forward to the holiday tomorrow. No work, just sleep planned.
Happy Labor Day! And my condolences go out to those who have to work today.
After spending my Labor Day weekend watching #SonsOfAnarchy , I think #CharlieHunnman is a good choice. I love #JaxTeller :-)
Hmm, so apparently it&#39;s #CharlieHunnam not CharlieHunnman. Either way, give this guy a chance. Don&#39;t think of him as just #JaxTeller
Once they make him over &amp; he loses the scruffy #JaxTeller look, he&#39;ll make a damn fine #ChristianGrey. #CharlieHunnam
I hope he uses his real accent in the movie #50ShadesOfGrey . Remember folks, he&#39;s actually British. #CharlieHunnam
for crying out loud, cancel this show #DancingWithTheStars
I&#39;ll definitely be watching this Sunday to see how #GenoSmith does #nyjets
I just did my pledge http://hpb.com/litfit/&nbsp;  #LitFitness

Great speech, Jim Parsons #Emmys #bigbangtheory
Um, who was that guy in the background that tried to scoot out of the shot undetected when NPH was announcing who was coming up next? #Emmys
Not sure what Jimmy Fallon is say. Too distracted by the possessed pic. #Emmys
Yes! Yes! David Fincher for House Of Cards! #Emmys #HouseOfCards
Oprah Winfrey announcing Jimmy Kimmel Live writers for the nomination vid? Brilliant! #Emmys
Congrats to Derek Hough! Very talented choreographer and dancer. #Emmys
Watching SNL premiere! Tina Fey is on!
SNL Cold Opening was pretty funny
Really SNL? No new featured cast members of color?
Wow that dancing is just wrong #SNL #TinaFey
Way to haze the new guys #SNL #TinaFey
Holy s**t! E-meth?? The commercials are on but I&#39;m still laughing. You still got it, SNL.
Ok so far weekend update is only so- so, but it&#39;s the 1st episode of the season so I&#39;m sure it will get better
So when is Aaron Paul gonna host? I&#39;m enjoying his cameos and so is the audience #SNL

@Chris_y25 wow, a stereotypical cowboy hat conservative Texan isn&#39;t happy, what a shock, maybe she should go home a bake something, yeah?
#Scandal in one hour!
@Chris_y25 going out of your way to pick on a woman simply showing support for a female gubernatorial candidate, yeah I feel the respect
@Chris_y25 yeah you definitely needed to intervene, otherwise all the world would have thought she had everyone&#39;s support
@Chris_y25 you know this is what I f**king hate about TX is the good ol boys that want to talk down to women and minorities
@Chris_y25 by going out of your way to pick on us, you prove us right
@Chris_y25 I bet you saw Wendy Davis trending &amp; couldnt stand it, so you went after me
@Chris_y25 remember, YOU started this. I dont pick fights with people who support Rick Perry. He wasn&#39;t my choice but at least I RESPECT him
@Chris_y25 good for you, you went went out of your way to ruin someone&#39;s day. Big man. Big strong man.
@Chris_y25 I cant stand passive aggressive people, don&#39;t start nothin, there won&#39;t be nothin
@Chris_y25 and that&#39;s fine, I understand our freedoms, I come from a family full of veterans, just don&#39;t target me next time, ok?
We don&#39;t have to all agree. We don&#39;t have to all like each other but respect goes a long way.

Um. Did she just ask that dude about his dreadlocks? #BeyondScaredStraight
I pray this #shutdown ends so people can go back to their jobs/careers and this economy doesn&#39;t get worse.
@thereverendmom your tweets have become less and less frequent, I don&#39;t even know where you are anymore ... what&#39;s up??
What would really make this a #happyfriday is if we could end this #shutdown and get this country going again
@MotherRose1 well put
Time for Shark Tank!
Seems like a placebo in a spray bottle #sharktank
You guys are nuts. Rapid ramen noodles is a great idea #sharktank
Kevin and Mark were downright rude. You two are jackasses sometimes. #sharktank
@kevinolearytv you could have at least let him speak
Wow, what a shocker. The two sharks that were the meanest ended up fighting over rapid ramen. Good job, Mark
@1capplegate @fruitwater hey Christina, I&#39;m sure a few of us out there would love to be your personal assistant :-)
Ok I really need to get back to sleep. Or since I&#39;m up at this hour, I could just listen to 3AM by Eminem and get caught up on emails.
Modern Family marathon on USA :-)
Watching SNL. So far it&#39;s not terrible
What the hell happened in the cheerleader/alien sketch? #SNL #MileyCyrusSNL
@thereverendmom that&#39;s all I ask :-)
@TheGoodWife_CBS seems like every time is set my DVR for The Good Wife, it records The Amazing Race instead! This is getting old.

@ultrami @SpeakerBoehner And if you were really a &quot;Christian&quot; you would know that the Bible specifically says to respect those in authority
Thankful the shutdown is ending. Hope the GOP, Tea Party, John Boehner, Ted Cruz, and all the other morons are happy with the mess they made

@LikeAGoodIdea88 I agree. No offense taken. I&#39;m in my 30s my first experience with racism was when I was 4. You learn to deal with it.
@DaveWright1968 and by the way check the statements they made about blacks before civil rights, that&#39;s the racist part I meant.

@DaveWright1968 my question is, they are people saying way worse and calling for a boycott, why aren&#39;t you going after them?

Time for #Scandal !!
@ScandalABC I like Quinn and Huck&#39;s working relationship. Huck has really taken her under his wing. #Scandal
@TheKateBurton I love that you&#39;re on this show! #Scandal
@tonygoldwyn Good guy. Bad guy. You&#39;re great at playing either. #Scandal
@TheKateBurton We haven&#39;t heard from the VP in a while, does she have any more tricks up her sleeve? #AskScandal
@ScandalABC Call me a skeptic but even though her ear was cut off, something still seems fishy with her #scandal
Yes, Huck! Keep digging! The kidnapping is fake! I knew it!! #scandal
Cut off my ear for 20 million dollars? Sure, why not? #scandal
@RoannaDee76 I knew we are Scandal experts at this point
@ScandalABC Never thought I&#39;d say this but I feel sorry for Hollis #scandal
@ScandalABC OMG! What just happened???!!!!! #Mole #scandal
Just when we think we have it figured out, we get thrown another curve all. Well done #Scandal #WhoIsTheMole
It&#39;s Good Friday. I&#39;ll be at service to tonight after work #GoodFriday

@AmericanGreedTV I missed tonight&#39;s new episode when it aired earlier so I&#39;m watching it now. Thanks for airing it again! #AmericanGreed
@LeslieCromwell Dude, tweet something
@tvland Wow, I actually remember watching this #GoldenGirls episode with Bob Hope when it first aired
I love watching reruns of 30 Rock every night. I miss that show. :-( #30rock
@nbc30rock As you know, my single, &quot;My Single Is Dropping,&quot; is dropping.
Parties are like Frisbees. If you throw them the wrong way they&#39;ll veer off in a bad direction then your kid will fall into a quarry #30rock
What&#39;s the past for scammed? Is it scrumped? Liz Lemon, you just got scrumped #30rock
Watching my favorite group of gals #TheGoldenGirls #TVLand
Is it wrong that I want to be Blanche when I&#39;m older? #TheGoldenGirls #TVLand
@LogoTV awesome that you and @tvland are showing #TheGoldenGirls
Didn&#39;t realize @Pharrell was gonna be on Daft Punk&#39;s new album. Now I definitely have to buy it. #randomaccessmemories
@RadclyffeBSB Loved The Lone Hunt, been reading the series from the start. I&#39;d love a story just about Michel and Katya ending up together!
My heart is broken. #bostonmarathon
@MelBarWright And also with you
&quot;Oh gold shoes? My nephew just joined the Marines to try to pay for college but ... that&#39;s fun.&quot; #30rock
&quot;And that remark of &#39;An Affair to Remember&#39; that I was in? &#39;A Blaffair to Rememblack.&#39;&quot; Tracy Jordan #30rock
&quot;Shut it down!&quot; #30rock
Ok so today wasn&#39;t a bad day but it wasn&#39;t a great day. Everyone seemed to be out to get me stressed or drive me crazy. But I&#39;m home now.
Ken: I&#39;m signing up people for the TGS softball team. So far I have 8 &quot;No&quot;s &amp; 25 &quot;Shove-It-Up-Your-Goon-hole&quot;s  #30rock

Another Regina and Snow White showdown #EvilRegal #OUAT
Has Regina been out-villianed? #EvilRegal #OUAT
I&#39;ve wanted to be a singer ever since I was a little ... drunk the other day and rented studio space #30rock
@tvland Look at Lou, he&#39;s got game #ForeverYoung
@ABCSharkTank the squirrel zapper is a terrible product but at least the sharks seemed to have fun playing with it
@kevinolearytv yes the zapper was a terrible idea and you were the only one smart enough to not be zapped #MrWonderful
@kevinolearytv Wow, he actually told you, you&#39;re wrong. He&#39;s out. #MrWonderful
@kevinolearytv you&#39;re the okra in her gumbo! Lol!
@ABCSharkTank Somebody invest in the gumbo blocks!!!
@kevinolearytv @LoriGreiner Wow!! You all are amazing! You are changing this woman&#39;s life! Kevin really is Mr Wonderful #sharktank
@gumbogeek Congratulations on making a deal with the sharks!!! God Bless you, your family, and your business!

Those burgers look delicious. The sharks always get fed. #sharktank
@ABCSharkTank @getglue I thought it had wheels but no pedals
@HappyEndingsABC I cant believe I wont get to see any more new episodes. This was such a great show with very talented writers #happyendings
Season 2 finale! I&#39;m on the edge of my seat!! #OnceUponATime #OUAT
And this is why I love Regina #OnceUponATime
You are the best! @LanaParrilla #OnceUponATime

@thereverendmom lol
Watching @theofficenbc finale! #thatswhatshesaid
@theofficenbc I&#39;ve seen every episode. It&#39;s a bittersweet ending #theofficefinale
Yes, I&#39;m unfollowing people. Nothing personal but the constant spam and retweets are driving me crazy.
The Dinner Party is my absolute favorite episode. #theofficefinale
Wow, Joan Cusack on @theofficenbc ! #theofficefinale
That&#39;s what she said! #theofficefinale

Great word - &quot;scumbagery&quot; #AmericanGreedChat
I wish I could have @StacyKeach1 record my voicemail greeting or even better, follow me around and narrate my life #AmericanGreedChat
Trevor Cook is the very definition of #scumbagery but that mansion was something else entirely #AmericanGreedChat
Another great episode, can&#39;t wait for next week! @AmericanGreedTV @StacyKeach1 #AmericanGreedChat
@LogoTV Love the Golden Girls reruns!
@tvland &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; reruns? Greatness!
This is way funnier then the one they air. #havertyslady http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaWFMTQQ6o&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player&nbsp;…
@MiaPleasant_ Yeah, hi, it seems like you&#39;ve copied my account. Any explanations?
It&#39;s only the beginning of June and I&#39;m already ready for summer to be over.
I would rather have reruns of my favorite shows during the summer rather than some of the crappy summer shows the networks feature.
Now that #30rock and #theoffice are off the air, there&#39;s hardly anything to watch on NBC
Oh oh oooh, oh oh ohh, oh oh oooh, the right stuff! #nkotb
@LogoTV I can never get enough #goldengirlsufc Best way to end a long work day #IWantToBeBlancheWhenIGetOlder
In five years, we&#39;ll either be working for him or be dead by his hand #30rock
Why do I pay for #netflix and it&#39;s not working?! I&#39;d like to sit down and watch some movies. Maybe I should cancel and get #huluplus
Gonna fly now! Won&#39;t be long now!

Ok, this is gonna sound weird but I want more episodes that feature women as the scam artists #GreedChat
@LJMercedes hey I said it was gonna sound weird! No judgement lol!
First of all this guy was way into the Confederacy. Second, ponzi scheme wasnt necessary if he had actually bought the silver #GreedChat
@LJMercedes hahaha!
@TiffanyChampion exactly! It was a genuinely good investment idea and all of his investors would have made actual money &amp; kept investing

@LanaParrilla Happy Birthday to the best and hottest TV villian that ever was.
Hey baby, what&#39;s wrong? #30rock
@RollingStone Tsarnaev is all over the media &amp; you all turned him into a rock star with your cover. What about the victims? Feature them!

@thereverendmom @whichwich I was not invited *pouts*
@thereverendmom I&#39;m in Mansfield now
@thereverendmom are you guys just eating your way through the Highlands?
I will miss waking up to your show. #ripkiddkraddick
@AmericanGreedTV Awesome! I missed it on Thursday. I&#39;m getting ready to watch it now
I love this episode of Martin with the white girl named Aquanetta LOL #Martin #TVOne
My prediction for #arielcastro - judge will give him 3 life sentences to be served consecutively but he&#39;ll get shanked his 1st night in
1000 years without parole, great job Ohio! That gives him ALOT of time to think about what he did to those women. #arielcastro
Ohio has got better prosecuters and a better justice system than Florida #arielcastro
Judge Russo is my new hero! #arielcastro
Another one? Yes! A twofer! Well done, Greed. #AmericanGreed
200 million dollars worth of wine??!! Give him The Chair! #AmericanGreed
He can have 27 years of toilet wine in prison #AmericanGreed
Thank God it&#39;s Friday. Three more hours and I&#39;m home free! #TGIF
FYI, everyone that tries to &quot;sell&quot; me twitter followers is getting unfollowed
Right Wing nut jobs are also being unfollowed. Everyone has right to express their own opinion, just not on my twitter feed
Watching #BeyondScaredStraight  I love this show. #AETV
I love the follow up with the kids after they do the program. Seems to have a high success rate #BeyondScaredStraight #AETV
@rezaaslan I grew up Christian &amp; I cant wait to read your book. Fox News doesnt understand anything about anyone that doesnt think like them
@rezaaslan If she had even bothered to read your book, the interview would&#39;ve been informative, your credentials spoke for themselves
Well, Monday, we meet again ...
@wobarlington I&#39;m enjoying my first time here. I had Maredous 8 and Chimey Cinq Cents. The wait staff is nice.
Watching #HouseofCards on #Netflix I know I&#39;m late but this is a great show
Halfway through #HouseOfCards I&#39;m going to make a whole Saturday out of this!
RIP Lee Thompson Young, I pray your soul is at peace. #RIPLeeThompsonYoung #RIPJettJackson
Yeah and so far, no one I know is happy about Ben Affleck announced as the next Batman
Wasn&#39;t the Batman franchise bad enough with casting George Clooney?  Ben Affleck is such a bad idea. He&#39;s better at directing anyway
That&#39;s a deal breaker, ladies! #30rock
&quot;You take a hotdog, stuff it with some jack cheese, fold it in a pizza - you got cheesy blasters!&quot; #cheesyblasters #30RockRerurns

David Alan Grier on Martin, playing Rev, Leon Lonny Love. He was a such a slimy character lol
Looking forward to the holiday tomorrow. No work, just sleep planned.
Happy Labor Day! And my condolences go out to those who have to work today.
After spending my Labor Day weekend watching #SonsOfAnarchy , I think #CharlieHunnman is a good choice. I love #JaxTeller :-)
Hmm, so apparently it&#39;s #CharlieHunnam not CharlieHunnman. Either way, give this guy a chance. Don&#39;t think of him as just #JaxTeller
Once they make him over &amp; he loses the scruffy #JaxTeller look, he&#39;ll make a damn fine #ChristianGrey. #CharlieHunnam
I hope he uses his real accent in the movie #50ShadesOfGrey . Remember folks, he&#39;s actually British. #CharlieHunnam
for crying out loud, cancel this show #DancingWithTheStars
I&#39;ll definitely be watching this Sunday to see how #GenoSmith does #nyjets
I just did my pledge http://hpb.com/litfit/&nbsp;  #LitFitness

Not sure what Jimmy Fallon is say. Too distracted by the possessed pic. #Emmys
Yes! Yes! David Fincher for House Of Cards! #Emmys #HouseOfCards

Watching SNL premiere! Tina Fey is on!
SNL Cold Opening was pretty funny
Really SNL? No new featured cast members of color?
Wow that dancing is just wrong #SNL #TinaFey
Way to haze the new guys #SNL #TinaFey
Holy s**t! E-meth?? The commercials are on but I&#39;m still laughing. You still got it, SNL.
Ok so far weekend update is only so- so, but it&#39;s the 1st episode of the season so I&#39;m sure it will get better
So when is Aaron Paul gonna host? I&#39;m enjoying his cameos and so is the audience #SNL

@Chris_y25 wow, a stereotypical cowboy hat conservative Texan isn&#39;t happy, what a shock, maybe she should go home a bake something, yeah?
#Scandal in one hour!
@Chris_y25 going out of your way to pick on a woman simply showing support for a female gubernatorial candidate, yeah I feel the respect
@Chris_y25 yeah you definitely needed to intervene, otherwise all the world would have thought she had everyone&#39;s support
@Chris_y25 you know this is what I f**king hate about TX is the good ol boys that want to talk down to women and minorities
@Chris_y25 by going out of your way to pick on us, you prove us right
@Chris_y25 I bet you saw Wendy Davis trending &amp; couldnt stand it, so you went after me
@Chris_y25 remember, YOU started this. I dont pick fights with people who support Rick Perry. He wasn&#39;t my choice but at least I RESPECT him
@Chris_y25 good for you, you went went out of your way to ruin someone&#39;s day. Big man. Big strong man.
@Chris_y25 I cant stand passive aggressive people, don&#39;t start nothin, there won&#39;t be nothin
@Chris_y25 and that&#39;s fine, I understand our freedoms, I come from a family full of veterans, just don&#39;t target me next time, ok?
We don&#39;t have to all agree. We don&#39;t have to all like each other but respect goes a long way.

Um. Did she just ask that dude about his dreadlocks? #BeyondScaredStraight
I pray this #shutdown ends so people can go back to their jobs/careers and this economy doesn&#39;t get worse.
@thereverendmom your tweets have become less and less frequent, I don&#39;t even know where you are anymore ... what&#39;s up??
What would really make this a #happyfriday is if we could end this #shutdown and get this country going again
@MotherRose1 well put
Time for Shark Tank!
Seems like a placebo in a spray bottle #sharktank
You guys are nuts. Rapid ramen noodles is a great idea #sharktank
Kevin and Mark were downright rude. You two are jackasses sometimes. #sharktank
@kevinolearytv you could have at least let him speak
Wow, what a shocker. The two sharks that were the meanest ended up fighting over rapid ramen. Good job, Mark
@1capplegate @fruitwater hey Christina, I&#39;m sure a few of us out there would love to be your personal assistant :-)
Ok I really need to get back to sleep. Or since I&#39;m up at this hour, I could just listen to 3AM by Eminem and get caught up on emails.
Modern Family marathon on USA :-)
Watching SNL. So far it&#39;s not terrible
What the hell happened in the cheerleader/alien sketch? #SNL #MileyCyrusSNL
@thereverendmom that&#39;s all I ask :-)

Thankful the shutdown is ending. Hope the GOP, Tea Party, John Boehner, Ted Cruz, and all the other morons are happy with the mess they made

@foxnation yeh the site problem was alot worse then the racist, hypocritical, nutjob GOP &amp; Tea Party shutting the entire govt down
@foxnation you didn&#39;t say crap when Bush put us in a war that cost this country billions and cost us the lives of thousands of men &amp; women
@foxnation you didnt seem to have a problem w/Bush borrowing billions from China refresh my memory he paid that before he left office right?
@foxnation affordable healthcare is good idea to everyone except when it&#39;s presented by a black man
@TAMARARUKE @foxnation oh right, I forgot, it&#39;s okay to go to war if he&#39;s looking for &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; yeah, my bad
