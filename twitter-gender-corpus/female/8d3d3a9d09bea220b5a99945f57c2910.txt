@Illustruction oooh like the driving game where you make up words for the last three letters of the license plate of the car in front?
@Illustruction oh maaan : ( that just made all my insides feel heavy

Glittery nuts! It&#39;s good to be home for Xmas : ) http://instagr.am/p/TlZ-PVHI45/&nbsp;
My last two posts do not go together AT ALL.
How was your Christmas?

@JohnCthulhu @Illustruction THIS IS A PROBLEM TO WHICH I CAN RELATE
@Artist_HB Ahh, thanks for listing me : )
So I went back to work today.. ONLY TO REALISE I STILL HAD TWO DAYS OF HOLIDAY LEFT -_-

@mayaemilie I like big butts, and I cannot lie
@mayaemilie Thanks dude! I got bored when moving to the detail phase. But I think I&#39;d like to work on it more.
@_XaKu AAAGH *dies* such a nice car :-0 How was it to drive?
@_XaKu How come it was your car for the day? Was it a track day?
@_XaKu whoooa. Have you seen the Audi R8 GT Spyder? http://bit.ly/Z386dj&nbsp; Oh. My. God. That gear stick with the production number :-0
@_XaKu I KNOW, RIGHT! Phoooar. Carbon fibre everything, oooh yes please
Really want to get back on a motorbike, you guys
@samjermy87 NO. NO SIDE CARS. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
@samjermy87 NO. NO, SAM.
@samjermy87 pfff well MAYBE I don&#39;t want to go to your sidecar party ANYWAY. Do you ride?
@samjermy87 Ah just do the CBT, I paid Â£49 for mine and can ride up to 125cc for 2 years. I want to go for the full licence as soon as I can
@CaptainChants Dude I&#39;m thinking of taking mine down, I haven&#39;t updated it in years! With my portfolio being everywhere but on my website..
@CaptainChants But then I don&#39;t want to lose the domain name GAAAH
When I was stuck in traffic this morning, I grumbled so loudly I startled myself
What&#39;s all this beef over horse meat?
Bet no one&#39;s said that before
Man, that was dry. SO DRY.
@BelgianBoolean whatcha doooin&#39;?
@ihearthorchata daaang you&#39;re EVERYWHERE
Want to draw, but there are so many tasty jobs to apply for :-0
On the lookout to hold an exhibition, you guys. Have YOU done one before?
@Polygoblin hey thanks for the RT, Ben
@kukas81 ah thanks! Hello @vmdolphin @ugyjijes @elixat @guillaumefavre @futuregeist @paguthrie @mattguetta @georgenijland @superpeo
You guys that wanted to model my artwork in 3D, I will be more available to work with you very soon.
@Amelia_Hirst There&#39;s a limit? Is it a forever limit, or a limit per day or something? Maybe it&#39;s to stop the pornbots
@Amelia_Hirst oh riiight. I have a clean out every now and then, make sure I only follow people that I interact with : )
@ErinHunting will you please upload a half done pic on fb? Then I&#39;ll climb all over that like hot toffee. Let&#39;s get this collab rolling
@ErinHunting oh man I&#39;M SO CONFUSED. Hey let&#39;s do a superhero woman? I&#39;ve not done that before. I think you should go first :-0
@ErinHunting ah this just gets more and more exciting
New sketchbook performance anxiety
Agencies that send emails requesting me to call back regarding a job offer WHY YOU NO JUST CALL ME?
Still looking for a new career challenge, the next step. A lot of these JDs are way too serious. Design is all about the fun!
Did you ever do an internship? Although I&#39;ve worked with interns, I am firmly against the idea. Hard work should be PAID with MONEY.
@MoonApe What do you think about internships?
@mayaemilie ooh. Did you enjoy it? How long we&#39;re you doing it for before landing the job?
@mayaemilie what&#39;s happening? It&#39;s the same story over here in Design. It&#39;s a battlefield! Artists cannibalising each other&#39;s work and stuff
@demafleez Yes that&#39;s what I mean. There are some schemes that are free menial labour, and others that are just ripping off good people
@mayaemilie Has your company experienced any of this?
@Darkengrim Hey, where is my sculpture? Do you have the mesh? I could take over if you have the obj for zBrush. Let&#39;s finish it!
Parents are coming over for Mother&#39;s Day SO EXCITED : ) !!! Mum hugs are the best

@Paul_V3Design Whoa. That is hot.
@toddmotto that&#39;s really nice, Todd
@LuminaUSA hey, nice Splat!
You guys, I am now freelance! Gigs are coming in thick and fast so if you need artwork, graphics or branding work done SNAP ME UP
One gorgeous image, hundreds of digital artists&#39; take on it http://bit.ly/X3Yo4J&nbsp; very inspiring
Looking forward to hopefully working with a rather cool company. The more I think about it the funner it sounds. EVERYBODY CROSS EVERYTHING
Ooh. Cookies.
Amazing what you can accomplish, when you have something else you should be doing http://on.fb.me/YbAnZF&nbsp; A scribble I&#39;m now neatening up
@theAngieTaylor oh, you&#39;re green!
Cookie overdose
What would you do if you were a cookie for a day?
@CaptainChants when does your tablet arrive?
@Polygoblin why? Oh I guess because everybody will want to eat you, right? NOT IF YOU GET THERE FIRST mmm
@odd_enough that&#39;s if you&#39;re a small man-size cookie. I&#39;m talking big cookie. GIANT COOKIE WITH SOFT CHOCOLATE BITS oh god sugar craving
@odd_enough yeah I&#39;d for sure eat myself. You are what you eat. So you&#39;d be a cookie forever. Like some kind of human centipede cookie man
@CaptainChants AAAH it&#39;s going to smell like &#39;new&#39; I love &#39;new&#39; smell
@CaptainChants ah yes! New Mac smell is the best.
@CaptainChants they should bottle that. Then we can all smell like new Macs all the time.
@odd_enough @machine906 we can lay cookie eggs and sell them. Like the goose that lay golden eggs, but the cookie version
@CaptainChants man why are we discussing such an awesome idea in such a public place
Aaah familiar freelance. No more free evenings or weekends forever. Still, can&#39;t complain when it&#39;s doing awesome projects : )
@odd_enough @machine906 cookie worms
@CaptainChants yes
@CaptainChants maaan the role looks ideal. They aren&#39;t getting back to me though : ( tried calling and just emailed to find out the deal
@CaptainChants the company and ethos looks good though and I could do so much for them hooo just hope it&#39;s still open
@CaptainChants if its gone though I need to keep looking, so I just asked them to let me know either way *hopes*
@odd_enough @marmalade_tim @machine906 cookie worms that turn into cookie butterflies
I want to get back into sculpting. Real sculpting not just 3D. Just got inspired by @garyscottartist
@marmalade_tim @odd_enough @machine906 no, those would be soggy
@garyscottartist will do, thanks Gary. If it&#39;s ok with you, I&#39;ll be asking your advice on materials! We have very different styles ooh
@CaptainChants I still got my fingers crossed AAAH let&#39;s see
@CaptainChants thanks! I&#39;m withholding my stalkerisms and not hounding them. Got lots going on in the meantime anyhoo yay : )
Collaboration happened over on fb between 3 of us artists with very different styles. @CaptainChants can we share it on here?
@CaptainChants hmm I sent another email last night. That&#39;s 3 emails and 2 voicemails hmmm
@CaptainChants I have another agency in Reading that looks good that I&#39;ll chase up today and see what&#39;s goin&#39; down
@CaptainChants YESSS is Rachel on Twitter too?
@CaptainChants I do :-0 and this time, not just for the money
@CaptainChants ok, I shared it and made it public but it still links back to the original which is friends only. Will it work still?
Saw one of @CaptainChants&#39; heads, HAD to add a body. Rachel Pierce then rendered it - Stunning! http://on.fb.me/Ws0IVP&nbsp;
@CaptainChants Yeah I saw that. Ha! Awesome. Let&#39;s SPREAD THE ARTS

Ah so now I remember why people with tongue piercings SHOULD NEVER CHEWING GUM
Need to make my main email address something less lame, but EVERYTHING is linked to that address. How does one do this?
Just found a hair that started growing white but then went black again. DOES THIS MEAN I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REVERSED TIME?
Oh no. It is white at the root and at the tip, just black in the middle. I have not successfully reversed time. THE SAGA CONTINUES.
@giffgaff Hello team giffgaff, is your position for an in-house designer still open? I&#39;m due a call back but am GIDDY WITH EXCITEMENT

@AndyM84 no I was just curious, not offering you any parts or anything :-0 cuz I&#39;ve got to find loads of parts for my Audi still. Oh god.
@DanMichaelAsh mmm Hugh Jackman *faints*
@AndyM84 I need pedal covers, wing mirror pods, door handles, some more bits of missing interior. This car really wasn&#39;t looked after before
@Superfried I used your blob font for the cover of my CV. I could redesign it forever but had to get it out. Thanks!pic.twitter.com/XnRgmz2Isk
@AndyM84 oh my god. Is that gasket damage? What car is that?
@AndyM84 aww I love that car! Yeah I totally get you. I&#39;d love to see the before and after
@AndyM84 that sounds wicked! I look forward to it : ) What needs doing?

@ThisCreative ooh your portfolio is gorgeous! Nice work, you guys : )

Huge big thank you to @MarkBugby for recommending my artwork on LinkedIn! : )
PS CS6 2B Pencil may require sharpening soon methinkspic.twitter.com/2mbYxLMpgi
@MarkBugby You get more than me!
Graphic Designer jobs, WHY YOU ARE REQUIRE &quot;SOUND KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF MS WORD AND POWERPOINT&quot;?
@BenNewmanArt how do you print? I was asking because your prints look cheap :-0 for the amount of awesome that they are
@mayaemilie yeah I&#39;m clean avoiding those jobs. They&#39;re clearly not creative, will probably involve admin. Until I get desperate ahaha
@BenNewmanArt oh so you do your own shipping? People are asking for prints of my stuff but hoo boy I don&#39;t know where to start :-0
@BenNewmanArt what&#39;s that portal you use for your shop? Your work is presented so nicely on there
@DigitalGuru Thanks for your email and for putting me forward. YAY I hope they call me in :-0 CROSS YOUR FINGERS FOR ME JAMES : )

Dear artist friends, when your head is bursting with concepts, how do you go about getting it all down AND finishing up pieces?
@BarryTheArtGuy thumbnails YES! I&#39;ve yet to work on that technique. I tend to get really involved and then it becomes 5am and oops work soon
@odd_enough Yeah actually I tend to sketch it on the backs of envelopes and then take pics of those, import and render later
Whoa. Woke up to the knocking of the HOTTEST DELIVERY GUY I&#39;VE EVER SEEN. I am now set for the day.
@dejanight cool! I like the way you do skin tone. Do you do the eyes last? I do, they&#39;re the best bit!
Good to speak to a few good studios and lovely agents today. Job search is going well. Hopefully I&#39;ll land something awesome soon : )
In the meantime, freelance and artwork is keeping me sweating. No rest for the relentless.
Thanks @CaptainChants for sharing this http://bit.ly/Tvb2uG&nbsp; inking brush set for PS. Worth it? Or do you stick to the default?

@GameTxtures why did you stop eating bread?
@GameTxtures gluten is the worst! Makes me instantly look pregnant. The worst kind of food baby. Glad you&#39;re feeling better though.
Also checking out another company that looks and sounds pretty cool.. WISH ME LUCK, YOU GUYS
@GameTxtures yeah same, I think it&#39;s pretty normal. Just that some of us are more sensitive to it..
@GameTxtures me too. Lets do this!
@dejanight they are pretty adamant that ALL APPLICATIONS MUST BE SENT BY POST TO THIS ADDRESS. What the
@GameTxtures @odd_enough or should it be, &quot;Bun of the year&quot; #glutenfree #humourfree
@JamesBlakstarJ I know, right! Though for the attractive salary that&#39;s on offer, I&#39;d comfortably be able to afford a stamp : )
@dejanight I&#39;m going for Design and Artworker roles, Branding too. I just love making stuff I can be proud to show off..
@dejanight yeah haha I&#39;m wise to the pornbots, don&#39;t you worry
@dejanight thank you, I will definitely get there. No doubt. Just need to focus and knock down some more doors of opportunity.
@TheGlutenBaby @gametxtures is that a food baby made of gluten? Awesome. Actually that blog sounds cool..
Artworking all weekend BUT IT&#39;S OK because it&#39;s sunny
Also, I can wear my fringe as a giant oversized quiff. THIS DAY JUST GETS AWESOMMER AND AWESOMMER

@Mospheric @odd_enough @arronwalker yeah, @CaptainChants has one of those and it looks pretty hot
The Yiynova website is awful. THEY EVEN USE COMIC SANS IN A HORRENDOUS BANNER. I don&#39;t even.. omg this is so bad http://www.yiynova.com/en/&nbsp;
@CaptainChants the rotating image thing is glitchy. It&#39;s completely unnavigable and they use default PS effect brushes and the colours AAARG
@CaptainChants I&#39;m taken aback at how terrible it is. Did that not put you off?
@Superfried ooh I like the first one :-0 yum
@CaptainChants it&#39;s definitely a concept I will get in the future. Not at the moment though I&#39;m quite happy with my Intuos3
Surely it&#39;s always good to keep inspired by the awesome that is out there, to better yourself
I don&#39;t understand why so many artists are put off by other artists that they consider to be &quot;better&quot; than them
Learn from the countless ways to skin cats, and find your own style
@_XaKu @BelgianBoolean AWWW so much love &lt;3 : )
@Superfried Keep it up, you guys. I look forward to more. Say &quot;Hi&quot; to Mark for me *waves frantically* *screams* *runs away*
@BelgianBoolean @_XaKu I&#39;m no longer confortable in this conversation oh god what have I started
Interviews don&#39;t scare me. I LOVE interviews. It&#39;s the endless, helpless waiting afterwards to hear back that makes me poop a little
@marmalade_tim @BelgianBoolean @_XaKu Ah yeah good plan. WHERE IS IT?
@_XaKu @marmalade_tim @belgianboolean wait what is it that you made? I&#39;m seeing a bunch of HDRs, is that right?
@marmalade_tim @_xaku @belgianboolean ah that is cool!
@_XaKu is this it? Daaang! &lt;3
@_XaKu ahaha yesss. SUCCESS! Curiosity got the better of me but I&#39;m glad I found it : ) That fan letter was nice. Went through your pics too

@VolumeLtd Love the movement and energy throughout your brand. The showreel is inspiring!
Just watched a Motion Graphics showreel that has inspired me to make some 3D and vector-based illos BUT I HAVE DEADLINES hnnng
@VolumeLtd I certainly am! I was called by Claire (who sounds lovely!) this morning and have been checking you guys out since
@VolumeLtd I must say I am thoroughly impressed so far. I&#39;d LOVE to be involved! You guys look fun and focussed. Gives out a great vibe : )
@ArtsyPabster I&#39;m going to do it. Right after I whoop this deliverable. Are you going to do it too? I can&#39;t hold it in! I&#39;M SO INSPIRED.
@VolumeLtd Claire is from an agency. For sure, thanks! Let me know what happens. I&#39;m sure Claire has passed on my CV already but I&#39;ll check
@VolumeLtd Awesome, thank you Rachel. Have a smashing evening and hopefully see you soon : )
@VolumeLtd Rachel! Gemma has indeed received my CV YAY! : ) Ok I better get on top of my work this end so yes speak soon : )
@ArtsyPabster Really? After I beat a deadline I just want to do more stuff, MAKE NEW DEADLINES. They drive portfolio and skill set

@ricardopresto ah nooo THE MAGIC IS GONE
@VolumeLtd Good morning, how are you? Hey it turns out that your HQ is 3mins from where my company&#39;s HQ was! WEIRD huh :-0
@tonykarpinski ah this is so beautiful. I want to be a cheetah when I grow up.
@Superfried @siscott77 oh god that&#39;s amazing
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. To get these Japanese graphics out of the way before working on my portfolio : )
DESIGNERS: If you work or have worked at an agency, how did you get in there in the first place without agency experience?
I&#39;ve had feedback on several occasions that, because I&#39;m a Head of Design, I cannot do an Artworker role
All I want to do is make cool stuff for people to enjoy and LEARN ALL THE THINGS
@nlr8 Yup I went from showing off the big titles, to diluting them, to putting them at the end of the list. Now I may have to lose them.
@Gafyn Thanks Gafyn. Where was your in-house work?
@Gafyn wow, and what are you doing now?
@Gafyn Groovy. Oh boy, wish me luck, Gafyn. I hope to hear good news form another agency tomorrow. I will keep an eye on the way you roll
@fartpalace Are you sure it wasn&#39;t pus?
@fartpalace oh god now I feel bad
The floppy disk means save, and 14 other icons that don&#39;t make sense anymore: http://ow.ly/jH8o6&nbsp; thanks @3seven9
@shad_0 @3seven9 I quite like the history behind them to be honest : ) adds an extra dimension
@3seven9 @shad_0 changing them would be like changing a language. Do you think they will ever change? Language is dynamic after all
3 more translated Japanese graphics to go LET&#39;S DO THIS *screams internally* cheer me on, you guys. I need you.
@talkthomas YESSS thanks Thomas! I&#39;M ON IT. Also, thank you for your kind comment. What did you find interesting about my blog?
From the commissioned 3D animation for IBIS Capital. See the finished bird in flight http://www.ibiscapital.co.uk/&nbsp;pic.twitter.com/nQAdKz27Bo
@talkthomas wow thank you so much :-0 that&#39;s so kind aaah I&#39;m going to melt. Yes, when it&#39;s something you love doing, it&#39;s just playtime : )
@talkthomas thanks, Thomas. You too, enjoy your evening. It&#39;s nice to meet you.
â@fightpunch: Obsessed with designing guns lately, playing too much FPS. pic.twitter.com/VaaW1pRDMiâ wow! I love this
Think the time is approaching to finally change my Twitter egg
@nlr8 @captainchants @pgcreatives I&#39;M IN A MEETING BUT AAAH THIS LOOKS INTERESTING THANKS NICOLE
@nlr8 @CaptainChants @pgcreatives ah guys, &#39;lose&#39; is spelt &#39;loose&#39;. PLEASE CORRECT THAT. Spelling errors are not the lick. I&#39;ll look today.
@lolwarlol dungarees aren&#39;t fashionable?
@lolwarlol pff. Never been one to follow fashion. Let&#39;s all wear dungarees forever!
Virgin Media. Why must you suck like so?
The Japanese graphics are sent! Yesss now I can focus in fun things tomorrow. Namely a cool piece of artwork for a record label. Stay tuned.
@Superfried did you also avoid joining Facebook when it came out?
@Superfried same here. Some sort of complex to do with fear of addiction to either. Use fb for art stuff but glad I joined Twitter now.
@Superfried so many great contacts on Twitter. Fb is full of people I went to school with that post pictures of babies and food YAWN
Going to make a 3D illo today. Once I&#39;ve spoken to the record label people about their artwork yesss.
I know they say &quot;pencil before pixel&quot; but hot dang all I want to do is go straight to 3D
Would probably save a bunch of time if I have a clear concept sketched out first though, right? 3D gurus, help me out here
Kinda just have it in my head and freestyle
@Superfried that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. Conversations with real people. It really helps your brand, too. But you know that already : )
@Superfried fb does have its plus points. You can make stuff spread quite easily on there, get your name out with offers and cool stuff
@Superfried to get people liking and sharing, as a business tool. Depends how you want to use it really. I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t post food/babies
@fartpalace I love your constant anger

I still really want a Nokia 3310
@maxwelloginni Hey Max, what happened with your harddrive disaster in the end?
@DanielDimmick I know, right. I used to stare at that phone in catalogues and drool
I want to draw a squid. A big, wet squid.
With SLIME. Yes.
Excited about a new opportunity that&#39;s come up involving Motion Graphics. YAY! Fingers crossed.
Also waiting to hear back from another studio that looks exciting oh man so many waits aaa
@snarkies aww well done! That&#39;s great news! : ) best of luck in your new workplace
Yay App screen design! This is fun, you guys. Just remembered how much I know about UX. FEELS GOOD.
@jakobgilmore who have you got? I&#39;ve got Sandra Bollock
Chicken. Roast chicken. All I want is chicken. Why is there no chicken?
@Gemini_official ah dang! When was this? Yeah I start showing my brake lights miles before I stop now, and make sure they are backing off
Looking forward to getting my car back. Tons of problems and seems the only thing I can do is throw money at it.
Oh, no no. Those aren&#39;t just normal spark plugs, those are PLATINUM ... :-|
Oh, no no. You don&#39;t have clutch cables, you have a HYDRAULIC SYSTEM and because it&#39;s Quattro, that&#39;ll be 5 hours labour please ... :-0
Oh, no no. You need new front brake disks. But yours are made of RARE AFRICAN BEETLE WINGS ... D-:
Oh, no no. All the parts I got for you are genuine and have a year&#39;s warranty on them. Oh yeah, you paid extra for that ... :-c
Oh, no no. Don&#39;t worry about that intoxicating fuel smell in the cabin, THAT&#39;S THE LEAST OF YOUR WORRIES AHAHA ... O.o
I love my mechanic
@Rachela8 I know, right. That would crush my childhood : (
@Rachela8 @simonapps Let&#39;s not forget that the media love to crawl all over stuff like this and hype it up. It could just all be dirty lies
@moodstrike My bill is now almost at the price I paid for the car! But hey I don&#39;t want to give it up, it&#39;s my dream car : )
@jakobgilmore Well oh my. He&#39;s got a cute smile. You should take it as a compliment :-0
@moodstrike Yeah exactly, it got so bad that I was faced with the horrible decision of whether I should consider selling it. Aaagh.
I wish cars were bionic and healed themselves omg how cool would that be
@talkthomas Yeah dude. I went from manual, to auto, back to manual. Didn&#39;t like cruise control either nooo. GIVE ME ALL THE CONTROLS.
@talkthomas Paddleshift was cool though. Steering wheel controls for the radio too, I miss that.
@moodstrike Exactly. I couldn&#39;t take that risk. Also I&#39;m totally in love with my car. Shame it&#39;s been so horribly neglected before me
@talkthomas You see those cars that park themselves? Nooo thank you
@moodstrike aww thanks! : ) I hope yours is smooth sailing from here, too.
Ok so, I just got the bill from my mechanic. LOOKS LIKE I WON&#39;T BE EATING FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH.
@MarkBugby Would you like to buy my 20&quot;s? PLEASE BUY MY 20&quot;s
@MarkBugby you never know unless you try. Also your wheels have 4 holes, these rims have 5. I HAVE A SPARE WHEEL KIT THAT WOULD FIT THOUGH?
Been in Illustrator all day. Still on Illustrator. Hopefully get this done before it suddenly becomes 2am :-0
YAY I GOT MY CAR BACK!!! Good day to get it back, too. Been driving about all day with the hood back : ) ..Think I&#39;m burnt
@jasonbroberts COOL! You attract flies like when one wears a yellow t-shirt? I LOVE red hair omg so striking
@JamesBlakstarJ Pff I just had to fight for the last, tightest parking spot on my road. I parallel parked like a GENIUS.
@MarkBugby a little purple Audi TT : )
@MarkBugby ooh I like Focuses. Turbodiesel, nice. Yup just got a flywheel in mine, too. Oh, no no. Not just any flywheel, mine&#39;s DUAL MASS
@PTMuffins ahaha.. I.. I dunno either. It just happened I couldn&#39;t stop myself
I just high-fived a mosquito
NO MORE OPEN WINDOWS EVER
@Polygoblin what&#39;s your strategy now? Also, how did you choose who to unfollow?
@scribblepuff AWWW SO KIND. Thank you so much : ) I look forward to seeing more comics from you.
@odd_enough @Polygoblin Ah, sweet. I try to keep mine around the 200 mark but lately it&#39;s gone a bit over. So many good artists out there!
@AllyAlbon Aww I love that! Very nice. Like a flowery giraffe pony &lt;3
@MichelleGArt RED: heat, passion, love, appetite, lust, warmth, danger, blood, beauty, happiness, courage, force, anger, fire, seduction..
@Mat_Stomp Yay. I FOUND A HEALTH FREAK! Hi : )
Going cycling, fasted. Going to beat my 7mi on Sunday and not die at the end of it this time. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT. Time to get on form.
Back from 8mi bike ride in the sun. FEELS GOOD. Soon I&#39;ll be back doing 20mi with no sweat. Yesss.
Good to hear from an exciting job opportunity this morning!
@odd_enough Why can&#39;t you do it anymore? I&#39;m pushing hard to get my 6pack back. Hip and collar bones are back on show. BEAST MODE.
@mystichobodev @odd_enough ahaha yup. Almost got squished by at least 2 buses and 4 cars and a motorbike today. Ugh.
@odd_enough @AndyM84 Pff. I don&#39;t want to hear your excuses. Just do it.
@odd_enough @AndyM84 Do, or do not. It&#39;s no good to &quot;try&quot;http://www.redlemonclub.com/brand-you/on-why-its-no-good-to-try-you-must-do&nbsp;â¦
@Illustruction ooh I LOVE IT! Are you happy with how they came out in the end? Good choice on colour
@asterixinspace HOW DARE YOU
@lolwarlol @asterixinspace ahaha! Hey look we&#39;re famous
@AllyAlbon and what is &quot;Ally-fied&quot;?
Might be getting a bodybuilder housemate! Yesss
Stuck on the shoulders.. thinking to cover it with hair. YES! HAIR!pic.twitter.com/Y8h7rryxMY
If only it was socially acceptable to store pie in one&#39;s hair, for easy-access instant sustenance any time of day or night. If only.
If only hair was actually strawberry laces. If only.

Just realised I&#39;m working tomorrow, so should probably NOT stay up all night on the Wacompic.twitter.com/5zaWjP449Q
@colinwren Makes sense. My best concepts happen at 1am. Must be when I&#39;m half-asleep therefore closer to my subconscious?
@jayp2468 Yes. But it would be sweet. GET IT? SWEET? *self highfive* .. *slowclap* .. *I&#39;ll see myself out*

@ronviers there&#39;s a lot of back and forth with this client. I&#39;ve been there for a while so have most of the say now, but still collaborative
@sav_1987 yeah! Thanks Sav. How&#39;s your job front?
@sav_1987 get a job in that 5 months? How&#39;s the project going? What is it this time, anything interesting?
@sav_1987 you want to be my intern again? AAAW sweet!
@sav_1987 could definitely do with an extra pair of hands especially with layout work in AI. There&#39;s always plenty to do.
Need a decent font substitute for Helvetica
Working on a new product for a client. Making new stuff is the funnest.
Don&#39;t know what I just ate, but pretty sure it wasn&#39;t food anymore
Just noticed that the home icon on the twitter app is a little birdhouse aww cool
Shoes. SHOES.
@MarkBugby as was abundantly clear this morning. Too much info? Too much info.
Isn&#39;t it cool that bees puke honey
@a_rehmankhan bees don&#39;t poop
Those that use autounfollow tracker bots, you realise you lose more followers every time it spams your account or DMs people? STOP IT
@a_rehmankhan I know right. You ever heard the term &quot;bee anus&quot;? Me neither.
Oh. I love when I open a template file in AI all hyped about creating a thing, and it tells me all the linked files have moved. I LOVE THAT.
TextWrangler is pretty sweet
@Gafyn Hey, I hope you&#39;re well. I applied to an awesome sounding place, they said I sound like I&#39;m more suited to an agency environment..
@Gafyn They said something along the lines of I&#39;m too much of a passionate designer for the role I don&#39;t even
@Gafyn ..but the agencies still want the agency experience. Whaaat. I&#39;m beginning to really LOVE freelancing though.
@Gafyn There is another place I&#39;ve got my fingers crossed for. So let&#39;s see. Ohh it&#39;s all so exciting.
@Luminersss ah dude keep strong and DO WHAT YOU LOVE, always. You cannot go wrong if you follow your passion.
@Luminersss s&#39;cool, yo. Just remember that you&#39;re doing this for you. Surround yourself with people that support your dreams and aspirations
@nlr8 Dude, would you be interested in taking part at the Croydon Bakeoff? http://christopm.com/index.php/the-great-croydon-bake-off/&nbsp;â¦ Take a look and let me know @ChristoPM
@ChristoPM You may want to fix your banner image on Twitter. Half of it is cropped off. Thanks.
@odd_enough You are just so NICE. Hi @Dralex789 @Mospheric @Polygoblin @TheonlyAlexW @ruthmadeline @mystichobodev @axl99 @_XaKu @Saferdan
@sav_1987 Depends what sort of project I&#39;m working on. Usually ComputerArts Mag, Smashing Mag, WebDesignerDepot never fail to inspire
@sav_1987 I&#39;m a busy lady. I like it that way.
@ronviers Hey Ron. I really appreciate your support and kind words of encouragement. It means a lot. Have a great day : )
@DI_KittyPants nice to meet you, Sarah. OH LOOK I&#39;m your 200th follower : ) *dances*
@ChristoPM it&#39;s uhh.. It&#39;s still not fixed there umm. Oh, same goes for your official bakeoff twitter there. Please fix it. Thanks.
@fightpunch I just LOVE that tooth head. Also love your style of drawing, it looks so effortless hnnng
@Jauxiles what happens? NO DON&#39;T TELL ME
@GraceSandford ahaha thanks! Nice to meet you. Yes it&#39;s umm.. iunno I just.. I felt inspired and it kinda just happened hmm
My hands were full so I licked the iPhone to answer it OH GOD THE SALTY GREASY HORROR THAT ENSUED
@drumstudiosltd hello! Your work looks great, though have you got plans to optimise your site for mobile devices?
@ChristoPM What, after you cheated on me by going to another Designer? I don&#39;t think so, chum.
@ChristoPM Just because that Designer was CHEAP, might I add. Seriously though, fix it. Thanks, chum.
@drumstudiosltd Yay! I look forward to it. Nice to meet you.

@VolumeLtd Yaaay!
@Gafyn I know, right? Thanks Gafyn. I&#39;ll keep pushing forward.
@WhyAlwaysMad Wow. Thank you very much! I&#39;m slightly overwhelmed with all kinds of feels
@WhyAlwaysMad this may be a big fat question but, how did you become a Creative Director?
@WhyAlwaysMad ohhh I see. Cool! So what do you do day to day? Have you always had an interest in games?
Designing infographics for automisation yaaay. Good to work with devs that are up to date with current trends and love to be challenged
Also, how do people eat green bananas I AM COVERED IN STICKY
@WhyAlwaysMad omg how did you get into Blizzard?! What were you doing?
@WhyAlwaysMad ahaha cool! I LOVE the character concepts in WoW. Are you happy with what you do now?
oh no oh NO OH NO I feel an inspiration wave coming on NOOO IT&#39;S BEDTIME WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN annng
@WhyAlwaysMad ohh I bet. AH I WISH omg would be SWEET if I could draw sexy freaks all day and get paid for it! I&#39;m a designer by profession
@WhyAlwaysMad well, digital artist really. Multi disciplined and always keen to grow my skill set. I LOVE concept drawing, always have.
@WhyAlwaysMad that is my dream, omg don&#39;t say such things you&#39;ll get me excited!!! What kind of artwork are you looking for?
@WhyAlwaysMad That&#39;s my forte! If you have some concepts in your head now, I&#39;d be keen to explore them cuz WHY NOT
@WhyAlwaysMad Money is important but not the driving force. Within reason, that is.
Ok going to finally clear out my room tomorrow, so that I can clear desk clear mind something something
Also, work is suddenly really full on with this new project. AWESOME!
Uh I got so into this work that I forgot to send the invoice oops
Recruitment people, a &quot;great place to work&quot; is NOT a &#39;benefit&#39; or an excuse for a woeful salary omg
@toddmotto filenames with spaces in WHY
Beautiful cycling weather! Going to go for a quick 8 miles brb
Much harder ride than anticipated :-0 caused by doing an hour of resistance before going. Swallowed some meaty flies, too. BACK TO WORK : )
@Daniel_Guru hello, I invited you to connect on LinkedIn because the invite email I got looked dodgy :-0 Hope you&#39;re well
@WhyAlwaysMad I like where this is going. I like it a LOT. Watch this space. What&#39;s the timescale on this?
@WhyAlwaysMad hoo boy YES PLEASE! Thank you, Tom!
@sarahljay I really like your website : )
@RyanThinker Why? I&#39;m torn between Freelancing and Employment I JUST DUNNO. Also, hi! Nice to meet you.
@estrildid ohhh nooo : ( I shrunk out of my expensive jeans, thinking of boiling them in the washing machine to shrink them hmm
@estrildid yeah, usually stretching whilst wet does the trick
@RyanThinker Oh, so companies are actively headhunting you? That&#39;s awesome. Recently, I made a pros and cons list between the two..
@RyanThinker What are the things you feel you are missing out on?
@WhyAlwaysMad I see. Cool! Well of course I&#39;d love to be involved, if you&#39;ll have me. It sounds exciting! Do keep me posted
@WhyAlwaysMad In the meantime, I&#39;ve always looked for a useful reason to draw weapons : )
@WhyAlwaysMad oh wow! Thank you so much, Tom! AAA!
@MarkBugby Drop top? Why 1996? It&#39;s nice. Is it within reach? Just get something that isn&#39;t going to cause months of heartache like mine!
@MarkBugby Though, ultimately, mine is beginning to prove its worth. I reckon go for it, if it&#39;s something you really want. Why not.
May the fourth something something
Saturday is so not good to go cycling on. Almost ran over so many people #PedestrianOverload
I HAVEN&#39;T SEEN STARWARS there I said it am I the only one?
@ColtonGeil None of them :-0
@ColtonGeil Yup they go way over my head. I did try to watch them once but snoozed all the way through
@RyanThinker It was fascinating, actually. Employment ended in a giant list of blockers / cons. Freelance had so many opportunities / pros!
@RyanThinker Do you not get that through your clients or out of work activities?
@RyanThinker Oh I see. I&#39;ve had at least 2 agents calling me every day! Nothing landed. Thinking now whether it&#39;s something I really want
@estrildid I DID IT! Put the giant jeans in the wash. Let&#39;s see if they shrink to fit, fingers crossed
Yay I&#39;m going to get to draw a MOTORBIKE LOGO! Sweet : )
Just watched the webinar for #AdobeMAX and aaa! So many exciting movements. This is going to be really great!
@jakobgilmore aaa! What for?
Why are there still May the 4th jokes happening I don&#39;t even
@glitchritual ahaha excellent ...*cries*
@CaptainChants dude, check out @yoillo ..what you reckon? Worth a mosey?
I&#39;m taking on commissions once again! I&#39;ll draw you anything. ANYTHING.
@christian_fei I LOVE DRAWING OCTOPUSESESS!
YAY! Got a gig! Now to get down to business : )
@Francext @christian_fei Two.. Octopi? Octopusses? Octopi.
@Francext @christian_fei Octuplets
@Francext @christian_fei Wait, do you really want octopusessesssssees drawn?
Confused by octopi
Every time I draw I see myself get better and faster and that just makes me feel warm and gooey inside
@Jauxiles omg @CaptainChants check this out. How much do you want to collab over this right now?
Oh golly I just LOVE UV GLOSSpic.twitter.com/6tMv03kLPV
Surprising myself at how good this commission is turning out, considering I&#39;ve not really explored mech this thoroughly before. YESSS : )
@twisted_k hey, when you work out does your sweat sometimes smell like popcorn?
@twisted_k eeew! Yeah I get real salty sometimes. About to go for a quick 8 miles after an hour of resistance. I&#39;ll update you on the smells
@twisted_k cycling, just hit 4mi
@twisted_k ok, 8.57mi done. Sweat has no smell. Normal saltiness level. I&#39;m apparently well hydrated. Hot dang it was WINDY.
Happy to see that more video games and concept artist recruitment people are looking at my LinkedIn : )
Will be riding a 600cc motorbike for the first time on Sunday. Have to do the theory test and omg when did those get so hard :-0
Totally awesome when a client is happy : )
@christian_fei I have plenty of squidlike things in my portfolio, check it out here: http://eggabo.tumblr.com/post/12848463644&nbsp;â¦ there&#39;s more in my archive
@christian_fei Let me know if you would like a commissioned piece, and we can sort something out for you : )
@Jauxiles I just had a vision from the Matrix
@talkthomas It&#39;s just so feely. Wasn&#39;t expecting it hidden in this booklet but ah, just adds a touch of glamour doesn&#39;t it
&quot;That&#39;ll do&quot; is the worst thing you can say as a creative. Take pride in what you do.
@talkthomas Yes, time and budget do have to be taken into account.
@talkthomas  It can be easy to get carried away, but we must learn ways to get faster and better without compromising quality
@talkthomas I get you http://cdn.chud.com/7/7b/7b7f0125_triangle.jpg&nbsp;â¦
@talkthomas Ha. Yup. Just been chasing one invoice for over a week now. That&#39;s the not-so-awesome part of freelancing.
Wow. Motorbikes are really sexy :-0
After this commission is done I&#39;ll definitely be exploring more mech and drawing bikes
@BenNewmanArt Ben, how do you handle NSFW warnings? Do you think they are necessary? I&#39;ve just plastered them all over my LinkedIn
@BenNewmanArt Ah yeah, that&#39;s true. I love that about your work. Such a tease.
That feel when a project is so fun that you forget to shower for a week &lt;3
@MarkBugby Well oh my. How does she run? Are you pleased?
Ok so, after two days of staring at and drawing motorbikes, this literally exploded out of mepic.twitter.com/nVnmfn14OQ
@odd_enough I actually couldn&#39;t help it wtf. It&#39;s the fastest skin tone I&#39;ve ever done as well! May as well finish it now hey
@CaptainChants ooh.. Was it Shaz_2?
@CaptainChants so, you&#39;re totally not into them in that way? It could be worth a shot..
Ok so this week I have proved that I have no self control when it comes to double cream and I can&#39;t help but drink it like juice
Can&#39;t wait to get out on the bike tomorrow. I&#39;m going to sweat out all the cream. ALL OF IT.
Mmm cream
@LauraHohman oh my god your hair is such a beautiful colour :-0
@talkthomas my invoice didn&#39;t get paid in time : ( another weekend with no money. Tom why do people think this is ok?
So far I&#39;ve had an average of over 20 recruitment agents call me a week, all loving my CV and proposing jobs
I get about 6 potential positions emailed through to me every day
But I dunno, you guys. Nothing screams &quot;awesome&quot;. Nothing looks like it would be worth the move back into employment.
Freelancing has been great so far. Tough, but great. Really enjoying helping a variety of clients and growing my skills in the right places
It&#39;s hit me hard this time round when a big client hasn&#39;t paid an invoice I was heavily relying on. That part of freelancing is crappy
I gotta tighten up my contracts and get serious. Got to remember that this is my life and my business now, not just a hobby anymore.
That&#39;s what makes it exciting. The thrill! I GET TO DRAW FOR A LIVING, YOU GUYS!!!
@moodstrike well it was kind of a forced choice for me as my job wasn&#39;t paying enough. It was also no longer challenging or growing me.
@moodstrike so I cut loose and started accepting clients and jobs that were knocking on my door anyway. I&#39;ve always had people want stuff.
@moodstrike the only thing is that now I have to set out terms and contracts at the start, so that both parties are clear from the outset
@moodstrike are you following @MoonApe? He&#39;s really great at tips and motivation in short, easily digestible snippets.
@BenNewmanArt Do you count naked boobs as genitals? Or are they just in the &#39;rude&#39; category?
Green pantspic.twitter.com/50mIZL6jUj
@BenNewmanArt I just love the word boobs. BOOBS.
@demafleez It&#39;s tough financially, with clients wanting everything for nothing. Also, I&#39;m not a natural business person, so that&#39;s new.
There really is no way of falling off a 600cc motorbike without injuring yourself. Let&#39;s hope I can walk again by Thursday!
I have a fat bruise that, if you squint really hard and use a lot of imagination, looks a bit like a face
@talkthomas Aww I&#39;m fine, thanks Tom. I need to be 100% by Thursday as I&#39;ll be back on it :-0 The bike is fine - it was cushioned by my leg
@JoshCallowayArt really nice stuff on your blog, Josh. Nice to meet you
Today I learned that as good as the engine sounds, throttling one&#39;s vehicle does in fact, have a considerable effect on fuel consumption
Passed my motorbike theory test! : )
@lolwarlol Thanks, Bozwonk!
@talkthomas Dude. Throttling one&#39;s vehicle, with some control, is the way to live life. That&#39;s what fuel is for!
@MarkBugby YAY! Also got back my ability to walk. MOTORBIKE DAY TOMORROW!
Contracts contracts contracts
@Luminersss meet people that share the same interests. As much as you should keep pushing for what you love, friends can bring you down.
@Luminersss yup it&#39;s important to also keep up your morale, too
Fell off the bike AGAIN and obtained some fresh bruises. But you guys! Leaning into bends is the funnest!
My brand new Doc Martens are pretty much covered in oil and gear change scars. Yesss!pic.twitter.com/3qZ5Ol7ML6
@talkthomas there was blood this time. I fell within a minute of getting on it this morning! Up the road and BOOM
@talkthomas but Tom! The rest of the day my progress and confidence was exponential! Apparently it looks like I&#39;m experienced :-0
@talkthomas I&#39;m pretty determined. When I&#39;m determined, nothing gets in my way : )
@samgrinsell ah yeah, brakes are pretty important ahaha. I&#39;m talking about the motorbike here though : )
@talkthomas I will be careful. I have no intention of riding like a dick. Though my legs are a bit black and blue atm, I value my bones.
@talkthomas Yeah exactly, drivers have no idea about what is involved in riding. So much info to constantly process :-0 I&#39;ll be safe
@samgrinsell and blood! Battle wounds, these are.
@ihearthorchata @Luminersss actually today that&#39;s true. I&#39;m sweaty and covered in bike grease. I also have wet hair that stinks like helmets
@ihearthorchata @Luminersss NOT THOSE KINDS OF HELMETS ugh fffffs
When it rains it pours. Got so many freelance gigs rolling in that I&#39;ve got to schedule time to eat! Good times : )
@K_Bowser_Wowzer Hey, thanks for listing me! : ) Hope you&#39;re having a great day
So I ran over my motorbike instructor today
@odd_enough not quite. 50 points is a proper rundown. Mine was just over the toes ahaha oops. I reckon 30.
@ronviers that&#39;s nice! It&#39;s a 600cc..
@MarkBugby I just want to get the license : ) then I can think about getting a bike at a later date
@ronviers they sure do! But the tests have to be done on a 600
@ronviers Honda Hornet. Makes a good sound, it does.
@ronviers I like dirt bikes but the saddles tend to be a bit high for me. Perhaps I can get one with some foam shaved off the seat to lower
NACHO, NACHO MAAAN
Wow, so many coding jobs coming through every day. WELL, at least I&#39;m clearer than ever that I don&#39;t want to go back to back end

Really keen to discover concept artists whether it&#39;s creatures, vehicles or weapons.. If you know a wicked artist, link me!
@ronviers He&#39;s one of my favourite artists. He has an attitude and a philosophy that a lot of artists could learn from.
@WhyAlwaysMad Thanks, Tom! *fist in the air followed by celebratory jiggle* ..How are you doing?
@ronviers Yeah man, totally awesome. I&#39;ve been following his tutorials for years now. It&#39;s incredible of him to do such valuable videos.
@ronviers I especially like his videos about what it takes to be serious about your passion. The investment of time, work, practice ..self.
@ronviers For sure. I like what you say about bringing someone&#39;s idea to life. Even when they may not always know what they want.
@_1000portraits cool, what a wicked idea! What is your aim from this 1,000 portrait project?
@jmgallo @wwwbigbaldhead omg I love this :-0 has inspired me to do another bw piece wow
@_1000portraits ok, cool. What will you do once you&#39;ve got to your target?

@ped_o thank you : ) it was super quick so I&#39;m pleased with how it came out
@BenNewmanArt Ben. BEN! I set up BigCartel so that we can be twins. Also, are you on a paid subscription with them? I just got the free one
The shop is set up now, so you can get prints! Ooo to decide what to put up first..
I&#39;d like some peacocks
Whoa. ALBINO peacocks. They are so beautiful I want to cry
@MarkBugby They are just so breathtakingly pretty.
@WhyAlwaysMad Yes MAKE time and come down! I&#39;m more into bikes than F1 but I just love speed. I&#39;d rather be doing it than watching it though
Experienced sexism to a hilarious new level yesterday. Being into technology and cars, I got used to it but that doesn&#39;t make it ok
It doesn&#39;t help that a lot of female drivers, generally speaking, do suck at driving. Come on girls, FIX UP. You&#39;re letting the side down.
Also, that many females don&#39;t take an interest in the mechanics of the vehicles they&#39;re pushing. Therefore know very little.
This means that a lot of garages find it easy to rip off female drivers. It&#39;s up to YOU to learn about your car so you can diagnose stuff.
@WhyAlwaysMad omg the new one? M3s are beautiful cars
Anyway, it&#39;s how you deal with it. Sexism is rife and even more so when interacting with male-dominated industries. Bring it on!
@MarkBugby Whoa, nice! That car is so gorgeous I&#39;d love to take one for a spin. Have you sat in it?
@MarkBugby Oooh lovely! Looks good in the sun, hey? My next car will be a Mercedes
@scribblepuff I agree. What I&#39;m saying is that a lot of females do not make the effort to learn, and that doesn&#39;t help the situation
@scribblepuff Makes sense. I see what you&#39;re saying. From my perspective as a female petrol head, I guess it does get to me at times
@scribblepuff My motorbike instructor was having none of it when we went to look at bikes. One of the sales guys was being SO sexist!
A lot of people are endorsing me for skills on LinkedIn. Awesome! But I&#39;m going to reach my skill limit uh oh. Also, how is this happening?
Good to see that a bunch of you guys are coming along to Animgather 2013 https://www.facebook.com/events/514534241934722/&nbsp;â¦ Be sure to spread the word
