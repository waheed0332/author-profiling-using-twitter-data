Educating about &amp; sharing Reiki samples with participants of Hemophilia of GA&#39;s Pain Summit today! #wellness #painrelief
We tend to think of people with hemophilia as simply having blood clotting issues, but many also experience chronic pain.
Listening to Dr. Jarrett Moss MD talk about the science of the pain response &amp; medical interventions for pain management.
Pain management is a complex area of medical practice. Often no &quot;cure&quot; for pain, only improved function as a goal.
Effective pain manangement is a lifestyle change. What you do is just as important as the therapy you receive.
