@joshuaclements our payroll + stock options taxes cause many businesses to leave SF as they scale, and should be eliminated
@joshuaclements I will bring an entrepreneurial spirit to City Hall.
@joshuaclements Entrepreneurs do more than anyone thinks is possible with less than anyone thinks is possible.
@joshuaclements Excessive fees + fines + the price + number of business permits have skyrocketed. I will take steps 2 reverse that trend.

@LeftMyHeart81 @paulhogarth We should not be doing tax deals 1 business at a time. The whole tax structure needs reform.
@LeftMyHeart81 @paulhogarth We need bottom up budgeting and more revenue. I also support a $100 per car mitigation fee.
@LeftMyHeart81 @paulhogarth We need to think out of the box and grow our way out of this mess. We are the best city in the US. We can do it.

@mmiddlebrook It does not make sense for parents to send their children from one end of town to the other to go to school.
@DavidCruiseSF @mmiddlebrook I will fight to give parents the right to send their child to a high quality school in their own neighborhood
@DavidCruiseSF @mmiddlebrook In addition to neighborhood schools, I support requiring annual performance report cards for all public schools
@DavidCruiseSF @mmiddlebrook We need a mayor that will put our schools on top of the agenda. We can do better with the right leadership.
@DavidCruiseSF @mmiddlebrook San Francisco&#39;s economic future depends on its schools. School improvement must be a priority.

@DavidCruiseSF thanks for pointing that out.
@belle2061 I support it.
@joshuaclements our payroll + stock options taxes cause many businesses to leave SF as they scale, and should be eliminated
@joshuaclements I will bring an entrepreneurial spirit to City Hall.
@joshuaclements Entrepreneurs do more than anyone thinks is possible with less than anyone thinks is possible.
@joshuaclements Excessive fees + fines + the price + number of business permits have skyrocketed. I will take steps 2 reverse that trend.
@allredtodorojo Can you send me more info or a website with more details?
