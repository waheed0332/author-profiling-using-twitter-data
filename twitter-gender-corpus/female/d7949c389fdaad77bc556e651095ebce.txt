@agnoster they worked on it full time. This was not a part time thing. http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/10/18/how-i-turned-down-300k.html&nbsp;…
@agnoster you are saying bootstrapping can be done
@agnoster It was but is not currently. It&#39;s like the 4 hour work week there are acception. I would say in general this is not the rule.
@agnoster people ask me to join their startup as a side project as if in some alternate universe one builds 3 startups simultaneously
@agnoster so this point is mostly to that. There is a lot of work with one
@agnoster I read the whole thing. It does not disprove my point. They didn&#39;t grow to where they are as a side project
@agnoster I by no means am trying to perpetuate the rule. People need to make their own. (Not advising illegal activity here)
@agnoster exactly.
