@LawrenceBland Of course, and I know you&#39;re joking... but in my opinion, just not a particularly enlightened or funny joke this time.
@LawrenceBland This is not a reflection on you personally or your general content, though!
Apparently, @YouTube is where shoppers are doing all their research, not @amazon. http://adweek.it/15iMt5M&nbsp; #interesting #trending

Make sure your media favorites get to the top of @Adweek&#39;s #HOTLIST by voting (as often as you want) in this poll: http://bit.ly/19ZkAoz&nbsp;
I think I&#39;m going to stick with my assertion that @paxdickinson is not a real person and/or was paid. So many targets looks amateurish.
I just found out that @onedirection has a song called &quot;Best Song Ever&quot; and the irony is physically painful.

... And now finally on my way home!
@samanthamcgarry Thankfully, it was under an hour, but it was a fellow passenger who saved us (he pulled a kill switch and got doors open)
@sonadelite Yeah, we were freed in under an hour (by a fellow passenger, though... the bldg/emergency services was taking too long)

Today&#39;s terrible #email #pitch: &quot;We saw your coverage of twerking and wanted to share a video response we made to the @jimmykimmel skit.&quot;
@Velocidi Interesting counterpoint, but Voice is a column, not an editorial or article. So it&#39;s the marketer making an assertion, not Adweek
@ivanlajara I did nothing of the sort. I am merely an editor. Any twerking is incidental.
@ivanlajara If there&#39;s any justice in the world, those will be the only three stories about #twerking I ever edit, ever.
@ivanlajara If you&#39;re dying to know (and I know you are) email subject was &quot;Real-Time Marketing: Electric Fireplaces Twerks it Out.&quot;

Editing a story that says women are supposed to have no more than 6 tsp of sugar a day. I just ate 22 mini Snickers. How many tsp is that?
@lorilewis What are you talking about? Wine is a health food!
OK, so to balance out the 22 Snickers, I&#39;m going to ingest an entire head of cauliflower. Cauliflower negates chocolate calories, right?
Today is an important day in history: @twitter will have the second biggest tech #IPO ever, and rapper Ja Rule has been released from prison

@Kai_Hazlewood I&#39;m surprised it wasn&#39;t spam-filtered...
@RossSheingold True, but I thought it was going to be a pitch about a 12-step program for beastiality addicts. I&#39;m disappointed.
@A_Rot Does it being Thursday mean that they&#39;re already drunk?
@A_Rot At least they&#39;re not pitching gluten-free dental dams.

@rorypw I feel like that stat makes it even less sexist... There&#39;s so much other real sexism in the world - no flack for Aflac from me.
@rorypw It&#39;s also altogether possible, if they have 70/30 ratio of women to men, that a woman wrote that ad script!
