A1: A desirable brand excites, cares, dreams, is a badge of stature and expression #brandchat
A1: Desirable brands also value their customers/audience. It&#39;s not about talking down to them, but with them--sharing a truth. #brandchat
A2: Unique brand positioning comes from zigging when others zag (as BBH believes). Finding a truth &amp; positioning it in relevance #brandchat
A2: You can own the brand&#39;s truth - sometimes it&#39;s emotional, sometimes rational. But has to be something no one else can say. #brandchat
A2: Define what u stand for, then find ur market, etc. Positioning should come first, then strategy. U need to know what you are #brandchat
A3: Market share, sales, WOM, buzz, and how many other brands start copying you. ;) #brandchat

@brandchat No way. I thought most brands understood that we need to move away from lies. They get found out. Always. #brandchat

@mariaduron exactly - all it takes is one small deviation to damage years of branding they built up. At least depending on how customers POV
@kavita1010 @admom1 I don&#39;t follow them so I only heard about it afterwards. ;)
Q2: For the most part, faking is foolish. But is also a old, overused idea. There has to be more creative solutions. #brandchat
@kavita1010 @mariaduron That&#39;s a great question - I guess if they did, the hack story falls apart. #brandchat
@brandchat @Shana_Fuller Disagree. Def is a wrong way w/ SoMe, mrkting advertising, branding, etc. New channel, same principles! #brandchat

7 things really persuasive people dohttp://lnkd.in/nGTufm&nbsp;
Great list.http://lnkd.in/xmuB7G&nbsp;
A1: No, and typos happen. But since most ppl scan when they read they miss stuff. W/approvals u think someone wld catch these. #brandchat
@brandchat @OliviaCRoat also using en dash vs em dash in last paragraph of top sentence. if you&#39;re going to be a grammar nazi... #brandchat
A1: Approval proc for social content is done often in excel, terrible for words. It&#39;s not meant for that. Prob how much gets in. #brandchat
A2: Professional &amp; on-brand is very important. But also must remember what ppl take away from it, isn&#39;t always ur exact wording #brandchat
@brandchat Hello! I&#39;m late and just jumping in! :D
@OliviaCRoat You mean em dash? En dash is the one misused all the time. Sad thing is, easy fix--just double it. ;) #brandchat
A2: Value of words are very important. And not just saying so because I&#39;m a copywriter. Too many don&#39;t care - only about images. #brandchat
A2: Standards of writing social copy are low, many times is someone without writing skillset, which can be problematic for brands #brandchat
A2: Also everyone thinks that if they have fingers they can write/type. And they can, but often they shouldn&#39;t. #brandchat
A2: Since most brand&#39;s social content is programed and approved, is even worse for them to have typo/grammar issues. #brandchat
A3: Proof, proof, proof. Build in enough time for process. Create style guide. Hire experts.Learn the rules before breaking them. #brandchat
I would argue that grammar rules can be broken. Write as people speak in advertising. But still need to know rules b4 breaking #brandchat
@mariaduron @SaraBethMcP And for consistencies as well. Especially if materials come in from different parts of an organization. #brandchat

A1: Understand each demo&#39;s needs, wants, hopes &amp; dreams. Some may be same, others different. Same goes for channels to reach &#39;em #brandchat
@brandchat TY! A1 I think brands also have trouble parsing out into multiple demos, but times it would make them more successful. #brandchat
A2: Millennials prefer to interact with brands on their own terms. Build trust through doing good, good service, etc. #brandchat
A2: Also, millennials are different but same in some ways- some still use same brands as parents, but other cases can be picky #brandchat
@brandchat @zacharyjeans I don&#39;t think 1 &amp; 2 are true. Maybe for some, but not all. Use has changed, not gone away #brandchat

A4: Lack of engagement, push sell, trying to be &quot;hip&quot;, failing to listen, failing to create experiences #brandchat
A4: Also forgetting that they are human and using human emotions/drivers. Make them part of the brand&#39;s story. #brandchat

And worse are the recruiters who don&#39;t get it either. ;) @mlitman
Emmanuel Lewis is a stand up comic now?
@darrellwhitelaw i completely disagree with that statement. @mlitman
@darrellwhitelaw @mlitman At the CD level the role requires being able 2 think visually and in words. I can direct ADs and designers 4 that
@darrellwhitelaw @mlitman Granted I can hack visuals together to get ideas across &amp; sell &#39;em. But I&#39;m not a &quot;designer&quot; doing layouts.
@darrellwhitelaw @mlitman yup. But they also need to be able to write at that level. CD is different IMHO though. Big picture. Less tactical
@darrellwhitelaw @mlitman Granted all should be conceptual in some way. Different hiring a writer as if you would a designer for executing.
@darrellwhitelaw @mlitman But I guess the degree at which to do it is what I&#39;m questioning. But I hear ya. I know UX, design, words, code...
@NKArch that&#39;s because most clients are afraid to have a personality for their brands @darrellwhitelaw @mlitman

You&#39;d think when a disabled train causes an entire subway playpen to be chock-a-block of people you&#39;d want to use employees help direct flow

@LeslieBAP I&#39;m a slow reader.
@TonyMarin feedly. Has reader migration integrated.
How do I know it&#39;s Friday the 13th? I&#39;ll be spending most the day working in excel. ;)
More reasons brands need to promote their social content across other channels.http://lnkd.in/d7SMJXX&nbsp;
@victoriadunmire Lol I know. There isn&#39;t much worse for a creative. But sometimes it&#39;s necessary I guess. ;)
@TonyMarin Yeah. I feel like feedly works closer to the way reader did - so transition is easier (or was for me). ;) But either works.
Going through my blog I found these two great old links to what makes a good CD: http://www.thedenveregotist.com/editorial/2009/march/5/rant-what-makes-good-creative-director-part-1-2&nbsp;… &amp; http://www.thedenveregotist.com/editorial/2009/march/12/rant-what-makes-good-creative-director-part-2-2&nbsp;… good reads
@adland I think we should create a PSA to help creatives trash &quot;O&quot; face concept before presenting it. #badad
Need creative director/copywriter/content strategy/creative strategy help next month? Hit me up with a DM.
@adland Ah i see. Missed the spoof aspect :)
The fun of freelance is lining up the work/projects properly. Can be so tricky. Definitely a case of timing is everything.
@bmshirley I do. If you buy often through them, it&#39;s a great deal. Also nice to get 2-day delivery free.
@bmshirley prob a worthwhile purchase. My in-laws got it and they &quot;gifted&quot; it for me to use as well which is nice :) I debated b4 myself. :)
@bmshirley haha i would if I could. :)

Happy I WFH today and didn&#39;t have to deal with commuting. Looks awful out there.
A1: If a brand doesn&#39;t have a purpose, it shouldn&#39;t exist. #brandchat
A2: CRM tools depend on whom you are trying to reach, where they are, their behaviors. No one-size-fits-all solutions. #brandchat
@mariaduron :) Hello!! Happy Wednesday or rather happy #brandchat day!
A3: I&#39;m actually curious about people&#39;s responses here. As contractor/freelancer - I can&#39;t afford many. So spendy. #brandchat
Lies, Damned Lies, and Mobile Statistics http://somedigitalthinking.com/2013/04/24/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-from-media-ownersnetworks/&nbsp;…  - a nice read.
@fairuse I tried a QR code - got frustrated with the QR code reader and never did it again. Whole process is kludgy.

Funny how warm 48F feels after single digit temps.
Remember Richard Marx? I had forgotten him. His Endless Nights is currently playing at the hair salon. Where is he now?
@KevinTVine seems like a waste of data points to collect.
@KevinTVine only if FB is saving/backing up as u type in the box. Could be a temp save, but based on past experience I don&#39;t think it does.
