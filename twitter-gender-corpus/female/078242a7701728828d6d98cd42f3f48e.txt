@WildAboutWhales  Awesome Twitter thank you, but do you have a QLD equivalent for when the whales get here?
@frank_in_oz AGREE. How can it be right that a few are Billionaires from mining a resource that belongs to all? The equity is out of whack.
@BiomeEcoStores Thanks so much for sorting through all my stuff! You put it sweetly about taking it all back to where I gathered it from :-)
@inspirocomms @tara_castle  You can tick off one of those 5 Kiva loans for me!

Just given 50 cents off takeaway coffee for BYOing my KeepCup by Gloria Jeans Toowong QLD
@GloriaJeansBBJ  that&#39;s great news.  I&#39;m sure it applies to any reusable cup you byo because esp. important for planet to encourage reuse
@blue_caravan  love quote about money and manure having spent much of today spreading the latter around!
Love that @merlocoffee Paddington just gave 50 cents off for BYOing my own KeepCup.  Another un-recyclable cup not on its way to landfill...
@BiomeEcoStores Gorgeous.  What a way to start life ... hanging on for dear life :-)

Best Australian article I&#39;ve ever read on &quot;sustainable&quot; paper, logging industry jargon http://www.bindarri.com.au/envi-carbon-neutral-paper/

Another advantage of a keepcup.  At coffee shops that won&#39;t use your name, you know which cup is yours - rather than fight over whose latte?
