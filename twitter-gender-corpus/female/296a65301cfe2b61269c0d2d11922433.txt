Feeling quite disconnected from my Twitter peeps. Hard to follow conversations when working on a single monitor.
Wondering what is up with my peeps - esp. @QueenofSpain @BlondeByDesign @bschorr @Kinchie @CharJTF and @spiderwebwoman Missing you all!
@CharJTF When is your surgery date? Late summer, right?
@bschorr You lucky dog. I miss warm.
@perricollins It would be easier to work on one monitor if I were at it more of the time here in Rockford.
@spiderwebwoman Rockford is cold. Unseasonably cold. Getting adjusted to life here. Healing (bodily). re-connecting with the network.
@BlondeByDesign Doing a bit better. Feeling human. Missing you. Glad you are well enough to keep busy. my frog misses your frog!
