We have a slow thaw in Wexford, the 1st house lost it&#39;s load with a whump! after lunch yesterday. Who has the best insulation?
The few cars out there driving are moving without caution, full speed down the street. Be careful it&#39;s not gone yet.
The wind is picking up here too. aHaa! Another Whump!. Doesn&#39;t the estuary look angry?  http://yfrog.com/hq63u01j
And there you have it the small hailstone/ sleet propelled by the wind. Now that&#39;s real Wexford snow.

I put out two ancient rusty legged Plastic chairs  out to make space for  the oil truck &amp; some one stole &#39;em last night. ?? #WexfordTown

@anirishgayman  indeed If you saw them you&#39;d wonder. I eventually located them up Trinity Street, in situ by the time the truck arrived late

@CreativeDynamix I believe artists should B able 2 explain their work. If the Author doesn&#39;t know why they do something it&#39;s therapy not Art
@CreativeDynamix instinctive work? :-/ Art created created 2 receive a response doesn&#39;t drop out of thin air
I hate O2&#39;s new iPhone app (end of Nov) I&#39;m practical rubbish. With Previous it was possible to view full bill better than on-line. RipOff
Before some on suggests the 02 IPhone app is free. no it&#39;s not Irish mobile charges are one of the highest &amp; no printed invoice any more.
The O2 new iPhone app is impractical rubbish, I&#39;m fabulous
