#NEC13  General Session just kick offed in Vegas. Big crowd. #ethanol #biochat
Bob Dinneen - we will not give up. Will will rebuild this industry #NEC13 #Ethanol
Look @ what industry accomplished in face of the worst drought in 50 years &amp; the worst market in memory. #NEC13 #ethanol
Opened first E15 station in Kansas. Txks Scott Zaremba! #NEC13
Produced 36.6 million metric tons of DDGs -enough feed to produce cattle to serve each American 4 quarter pounders a week for a year #NEC13
On a corn-equivalent basis, #ethanol industry produced enough DDGs to be the 4th largest corn producer on the planet. #NEC13
The real news in 2012 - first commercial cellulose #ethanol plant was completed &amp; several others began construction.  #NEC13
Most recent data concludes #corn #ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 48-59% when compared directly to gasoline. #NEC13
and reduced GHG emissions by 34% even when highly uncertain, speculative land use emissions are added. #NEC13
As for our industry – we don’t wait for things to happen to us. We make things happen. #NEC13 (Bob Dinneen&#39;s state of the industry address)
The American #ethanol industry will continue to command our destiny by building demand at home and abroad. #NEC13
The Battle for the Barrel is a fight for higher #ethanol blends – especially #E15.   #NEC13
We’re (RFA) also fighting the Battle for the Barrel around the world, from Brussels to Brazil.  #NEC13 #ethanol
RFA led fight against EU’s nonsensical trade cases. Won the anti-subsidy case, and will ultimately prevail in anti-dumping case #NEC13
Our government should be fighting for us, not against us. #NEC13 #ethanol #biochat
Without Uncle Sam’s federal finger on scales, U.S. produced #ethanol is the lowest cost ethanol in the world. #NEC13
The message: Don&#39;t Mess With the RFS! #NEC13 #ethanol
Most critical challenge #ethanol will face this year, will be the well-funded &amp; highly charged political fight over RFS #NEC13
Big Oil’s argument against the RFS begins with a mythology they’ve created about cellulose... #NEC13 #ethanol
...that RFS requires them to blend fuels that don’t exist and taxes them for obligations not met. #NEC13 #ethanol
Mantra must be - Don&#39;t Mess with the RFS! #NEC13 #ethanol
Top 5 oil companies made enough gross profit in less than 10 minutes to cover cost of a years’ worth of cellulosic waiver credits #NEC13
Cellulosic #ethanol &amp; other advanced biofuels are coming. RFS is a key to getting financing for those projects. #NEC13
Big Oil has a multimillion dollar war-chest. But they’re still short of one precious thing – a sense of shame. #NEC13 #ethanol
RFS was always intended to do two things: drive technology, and drive the marketplace. It is doing both. #NEC13 #ethanol
The blendwall can be breached. It can be scaled with #E15. #NEC13 #ethanol
The blendwall is a barrier of the oil companies’ own making. We cannot reward bad behavior. #NEC13 #ethanol
Creative narrative from Big Oil: increased domestic oil production from nonconventional sources obviates need for renewable fuels.  #NEC13
This is the fact. Domestic production from conventional sources continues to fall. #NEC13 #ethanol
Cannot frack way to energy independence. The need for domestic renewable fuels remains as important as ever. #NEC13 #ethanol
When the Battle of Britain began, Winston Churchill spoke four simple words, “We will never surrender.” #NEC13 #ethanol
Our industry has never wilted in the face of adversity. #NEC13 #ethanol
Men &amp; women of American #ethanol toil day in and day out to provide consumers with #ethanol. #NEC13
Together, we are steeling for the fight ahead. Together, we remain resolute. Together, we will see #E15 commercialized. #NEC13
Together, will make sure RFS is preserved – we will, never, ever, let them mess with RFS! We will win the Battle for the Barrel. #NEC13
Bob Dinneen&#39;s speech during #NEC13 in Vegas will be posted @domesticfuel later today. Watch for conf. stories. #ethanol #biochat

Vilsack: If the U.S. doesn&#39;t keep engaging in #ag research, U.S. will lose global leadership position. Must dedicate funds.
Vilsack: USDA has lost $1B in funding since he took office. #IFBF13
Removing nutrition programs from Farm Bill is not in best interest of farmers or families. #ag #IFBF13
If Congress does not pass a Farm Bill by Sept 30 Do not succumb to extension says Vilsack it rewards bad behavior. #ag #IFBF13
Only time Congress works is when there is a crisis says Vilsack. They must do the work now. Can&#39;t reward failure. #ag #IFBF13
