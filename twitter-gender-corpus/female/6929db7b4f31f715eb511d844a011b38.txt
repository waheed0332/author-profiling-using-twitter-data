Looking forward to the #blogchatie this evening. Here&#39;s what it&#39;s abouthttp://www.writeontrack.ie/blogging-for-success/blogchatie/#&nbsp;…
@Blogshane Thanks for the RT
.@JBBC Hi Marie and everyone on #blogchatie
Re introductions: I&#39;m Beatrice and I am editor of the Sage.ie blog and I also guest blog for a number of sites  #blogchatie
My goal would be to find the time to blog more often and to comment on more blogs #Blogchatie
Making blogging resolutions is one thing but keeping them is another, a blogging calendar is helpful for this #blogchaite
@ConallOM @mediahqnews or bloggers anonymous! #blogchattie
@WriteOnTrack_L @thereluctantsc also depends on how much discussion you&#39;re getting on other ones you&#39;ve posted #blogchatie
@WriteOnTrack_L @thereluctantsc some LinkedIn groups are just saturated with spammy links to blog posts, don&#39;t you think? #blogchatIE
@TheReluctantSC I&#39;ve been guilty of it myself, it&#39;s easy to get carried away when trying to increase an audience #blogchatie
@paulinesargent yeah #blogchatIE is a great idea of @WriteOnTrack_L  and @JBBC
@mindfulproduct yeah long posts can be broken into two parts, better way of using the content I think #blogchatIE
@gettapsandsinks you can unsubscribe to the email updates, otherwise it is too much I agree
@kevinmarkham you&#39;ll have to take a photo of me as I dodge golf balls, power walking the track around the golf course in Heritage, Killenard
@DrivingForWork @gettapsandsinks @kevinmarkham @mindfulproduct I tried putting quotes from each section post in as an image #blogchaite
@DrivingForWork @gettapsandsinks @kevinmarkham @mindfulproduct got that idea from @Hamperlady, then posted one of the images to our FB page
@3keyscoach @jbbc @writeontrack_l agree #blogchaite was great and for some reason I couldn&#39;t even see the spammers, feel like I missed out!
I&#39;m at #KLCK bloggers network, discussing bloggers block and other topics
Americans comment on blogs more than we do in Ireland, why is that? #KLCK

@WriteOnTrack_L yeah but I&#39;m sure you could do the same in gimp
@WriteOnTrack_L thanks yeah some great tips in there by @avrilmcardle
@auntyamo @writeontrack_l nah I like to keep things nice and easy :)
Feeling a bit jealous of the Kevin Abosch portraits in my twitter stream, remember them from the websummit. He makes geeks look good.

@pauldonno surely one Guinness wouldn&#39;t do any harm ;)
@pauldonno won&#39;t get to hear your talk in person but I&#39;ll be watching on Twitter #FutureOfAccounting
Speaking at day 2 of the @FingalCEB Bootcamp @CartonHouse tmrw. Will be discussing how online can change your business model. #fceb2013
@pauldonno great example of a scheduled tweet and I&#39;m even more sorry I&#39;m missing your talk now
How time flies around again, preparations for the 2013 Blog Awards Ireland now underway.
@avonfromfiona sorry thought I was :)
@avonfromfiona following there now
Sounds like @BookMarkLee is giving a really good talk on social media for accountants at #FutureOfAccounting. Cutting through the hype.
@TrevorKoen could we be more unlucky?
Okay twitter give me a number between 2 and 6
@Ross_McConnell has to be a full number, at the dogs!
@DMcAPhotography okay going for 4
@Paullyie 3 it is you&#39;ve just decided my faith
@Ross_McConnell yeah it&#39;s on 4
@DMcAPhotography no it didn&#39;t, ah well
@Paullyie and 4 went the wrong way!
Looking forward to hearing Dee @greensideupveg talking all about her blog and Blogger vs Wordpress at #KLCK tonight
Dee started her blog in 2009, it&#39;s all Lorna Sixsmith&#39;s fault #KLCK
Wordpress vs Blogger which do you prefer? #KLCK
Control seems to be a major benefit of having blog site vs a traditional website, update it yourself instead of asking web developer #KLCK
Dee blogs for her existing customers, to give them info they need, why do you blog? #KLCK
Dee says for a personal blog, blogger is good as its very easy to change the themes #KLCK
Google loves frequently updated sites so blogs tend to rank well #KLCK
Both Blogger and http://WordPress.com&nbsp; have very good mobile versions that come as standard #KLCK
Commenting facility on Blogger is not great, often prevents people from commenting  #KLCK
@cdynamics We&#39;re discussing your blogger blog at #KLCK bloggers network, we like how your readers can choose their theme
Dee @greensideupveg sells these seeds, I love her packaging #KLCKpic.twitter.com/dPwxEe7G
Better get some shut eye, off to @measurementconf tomorrow, up at the crack of dawn but looking forward to it #donedealsocial
.@itsrealTED: &#39;If you try to wake me up by pulling my blankets off, I&#39;ll probably kill you.&#39; That was so my 3 year old this morning,
Terrible stressful evening as two charge points not working, eventually got home after pissing off all motorway drivers by driving 50kmph
That&#39;s never happened before I&#39;ve been really lucky with charge points up to now, resulting stress was not good though, bring on the carbs
Esp for Chinese New Year Here&#39;s a game of business snakes and ladders http://ow.ly/hy4IB&nbsp; #yearofthesnake
@Spiderworking waves back to ya
Has it started yet? I&#39;m running late #donedealsocial
@TheReluctantSC are you going Eamonn?
@cianodriscoll slow them down for me, create a diversion when I walk in late
@cianodriscoll oh mouse under chair is always good, will keep everyone on their toes
@rickoshea delighted to hear as I&#39;m running late, they&#39;re all decoys I asked to buy me some time #donedealsocial #waitforme
@aoifep great, lots to catch up on, feeling very old when I added up the years
Brian Harte from Tourism Ireland talks about using social to create consideration for Ireland as a place to visit #donedealsocial
@PaulMDonovan I&#39;d recommend http://prezi.com&nbsp;
Tourism Ireland have 18 Facebook pages, needed as cultural differences require a separate page for each target market #donedealsocial
Engagement is relevant as it happens prior to the state change, it&#39;s not ultimate goal of social but it contributes to it #donedealsocial
By 2015 we will reach &#39;peak desktop&#39; - after then the number of people that view our site on desktop will decline #donedealsocial
&#39;7% of people go to a store to look at the product and then go home and buy it online&#39; #donedealsocial
@donald_richard sure, will have a goo at it later, no speakers from Sage #tuttut
Using a sentiment and social media monitoring tool  you could automatically filter out the mentions that don&#39;t apply #donedealsocial
A website is for life, not just for Christmas! #donedealsocial
@aoifep coming to seek you out for coffee
@TheReluctantSC I&#39;m blind so can you find me so we can grab a coffee?
Goodie bags yipeeeeee #donedealsocialpic.twitter.com/6ZKyazQz
@donald_richard will certainly have a look and see if I can make it, thanks for the invite
@cianodriscoll Was going to walk in and shout &#39;Mark Zuckerberg is in the lobby looking for a social media specialist&#39; but decided against it
Being entertained by the creator of Condescending Corporate Brand Page @JonMorter, &#39;i&#39;ts all bollocks&#39; #donedealsocial
. @jonmorter is giving the most entertaining talk I&#39;ve ever been to at #donedealsocial
@WriteOnTrack_L @jonmorter yeah and it&#39;s very funny
Barry Hand brining us through &#39;How to track value of Social using Google Analytics&#39; at #donedealsocialpic.twitter.com/CKCLhiJT
@CadburyIreland You here at measurement conf? Want to thank you in person for choc you gave for goodie bags for an event last year
Barry Hand advises that Google Analytics &#39;won&#39;t give you all the numbers you want, it&#39;s not like Sage software&#39; love that! #donedealsocial

@ElementTechWare thanks, will do
@WolfgangDigital of course not, was saving my tweets for you for tomorrow, remember to give us some killer one liners to tweet!
@WolfgangDigital &#39;What does BLOG stand for? A Better Listing On Google.&#39; For this and more cheesy one liners, keep following :)
@WolfgangDigital Glad I could be of service :)
@paulinesargent thanks Pauline
Just 2 requests for today&#39;s speakers, pls don&#39;t tell us digital is the future or that we need a mobile site #wealreadyknow #digital_summit

Are any of the #digiwomen at

There&#39;s @WolfgangDigital jetting off to the US for another conference, ahh the life of an SEO expert #takemewithyou
@Spiderworking @jilloherlihy @paulinesargent @aoiferigney was trying to get one of the guys in the office to do #digidrag but none would :(
Regulation smegulation...only kidding I&#39;m totally compliant! #digital_summit
@BrianHonan great talk, nicely balanced, useful info, good examples
In this world of digital and social we actually don&#39;t share what were working on with each other #digital_summit
Day of the app is challenged, as people move to their 2nd smart phone they will only download 5 apps they will actually use #digital_summit
@Spiderworking ah bugger
Death to the desktop website by @Brando_Digital at #digital_summit Desktop websites will behave like mobile websites
By 2015 we will reach peak desktop,num of people looking at website on desktop will decline as mobile takes over #digital_summit @iqcontent
@OlwenIBI it was great, so sorry for not getting back to you, up to my eyes but your top of my list when back in office tomorrow
@OlwenIBI was talking to someone about you yesterday that said you&#39;re great, but sur I knew that
@OlwenIBI ah now, all will be revealed in good time
@PierceComms @digital_summit @firstpageie @niallmckeown you are #digiflirts
@dmigroup @piercecomms @digital_summit @firstpageie @niallmckeown no body parts please! #digiflirts

@badams the #digiwoman initiative will like that post  http://www.stateofsearch.com/fighting-sexism-a-digital-conferences/&nbsp;… /cc @digital_summit
@badams good points there, the @BlogAwardsIE are organized by three women and at last years event we had a female MC too
@badams yeah sur it&#39;s always the same, for me I don&#39;t mind if the speakers are make or female once they give a good presentation
I think 4 FB posts from a brand a day is way too much, people will just hide your posts from their newsfeed #digital_summit
@WolfgangDigital yeah you could do lots of tweets a day if they are well spaced out and provide value
@PierceComms @digital_summit @ncirldigital thanks, I try to provide light amusement wherever I go!
MT @sageireland: Paul here from the Sage webstore on Twitter today. pic.twitter.com/IgHnGTs6k6 &gt; love the pic

@O2IRL on a plan that well exceeds my needs, been charged for roaming and text add ons that I don&#39;t use
@noel_davidson yes, am considering my options as they say. I&#39;m well but not as well as those peeps that get a full page in the SBP ;)

On my way into @iia conf on inbound marketing - content is king
Here at the @iia seminar in the digital hub. Coming up are talks from @WolfgangDigital and @HubSpot #contentisking
Here is the inbound marketing methodology Hubspot use via @searchbrat speaking at #contentddpic.twitter.com/FclYJT3LtS
Think like a media company, what would a publisher do? #contentdd
Don&#39;t forget about context in your content marketing, tailor content to what your customers are interested in, use customer data #contentdd
Personalise email content based on what content each person previously downloaded #contentdd
First step of content marketing, build buyer personas. #contentddpic.twitter.com/oVi85M8wEQ
Measure like a boss #contentddpic.twitter.com/FNkBVnpczw
.@hlinehan is up next to tell us what media and publishing companies think about content marketing #contentdd
Porus Paywalls: the future of online newspapers? #contentdd
Display advertising is dead, long live content sponsorship! #contentdd
Content sponsorship only works if the content fits with the brand and audience of the publisher #contentdd
Create content that is so good people would pay for it and then give it for free - that is my biggest content marketing tip #contentdd
@hlinehan really enjoyed that, thanks
@WolfgangDigital arts graduates with marketing postgrads also make great content marketers ;)
@TitanicBelfast planning my ecar charging route so I can make it up to Game of Thrones exhibit

@TrevorKoen just saw this tweet, how very relevant
