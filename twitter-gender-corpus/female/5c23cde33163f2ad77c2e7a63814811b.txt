@owenswims93 Any ideas pop into your mind?  One thing I think is interesting is how small the sub-world of OW swimming is.  See next tweet
@owenswims93 I wonder if a true insider like you could tell the world about the global OW scene- a glimpse in for people who know nothing
@owenswims93 Although that might be too long- but it&#39;s one thing people repeatedly ask me about.
@owenswims93 Like: is it odd that u know both Damien &amp; Jen Schumacher?  From Argentina and the US-- you from Ireland?  I think that&#39;s cool.
@DocumentDriven @ClintonGlobal @SusanUtley @writehedgebrook @worldreader @BookLoversInc @TheBookCellar Thanks and happy holidays!

@NickKristof Couldn&#39;t agree more. And the key to getting educated girls is getting the reading materials they need. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-risher/on-international-day-of-t_b_1955180.html&nbsp;…
@MattSchofield Great! Thx! Just looked at my cc bill and calculated that they read on average 8 books a week! @Kindle
@Oprah We&#39;ve seen that Kindles even the playing field between boys and girls in schools in Africa. Please see VIDEO http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-risher/on-international-day-of-t_b_1955180.html&nbsp;…

@owenswims93 Any ideas pop into your mind?  One thing I think is interesting is how small the sub-world of OW swimming is.  See next tweet
@owenswims93 I wonder if a true insider like you could tell the world about the global OW scene- a glimpse in for people who know nothing
@owenswims93 Although that might be too long- but it&#39;s one thing people repeatedly ask me about.
@owenswims93 Like: is it odd that u know both Damien &amp; Jen Schumacher?  From Argentina and the US-- you from Ireland?  I think that&#39;s cool.
@DocumentDriven @ClintonGlobal @SusanUtley @writehedgebrook @worldreader @BookLoversInc @TheBookCellar Thanks and happy holidays!
