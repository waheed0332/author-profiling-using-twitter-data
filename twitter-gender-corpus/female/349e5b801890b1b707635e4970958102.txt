Just revolting. Even if Dasma secu had lapses in their procedure, why was show of gun power necessary, Mayor Binay? http://m.inquirer.net/newsinfo/?id=548765&nbsp;…
Binay&#39;s peg: what are we in power for ? RT @peacheshonestly: disappointing. Very disappointing.
Too much show of power “@buwayahman:  (devil’s advocate) ...even misconstrued as an assassination attempt. Still, I detest their attitude”
@rochellesychua saying assuming Lapse in security. Still not a reason to flaunt arrogance of power
This is a 2016 preview “@LaTtEX: @rochellesychua  Looks like wang wang culture will be back in full swing when Binays rise to power in 2016

Looking forward to this. Really sick of @enjoyglobe spam &gt; Mandatory SIM card registration pushed - Read:http://bit.ly/1cJAWnM&nbsp;
I wonder if @enjoyGlobe employees ever get spammed with useless SMS from banks , real estate ? I keep these SMS for documentation
Tip: if you add a symbol to your password, e.g. $, ∑, it is 1,500 times more difficult to hack it - http://news.yahoo.com/trick-for-safer-passwords-that-are-easy-to-remember-152045926.html?vp=1&nbsp;…
What kind of registration “@BlissfulLiving2:  @enjoyGLOBE When you buy new prepaid sim cards there is registration na. Within 2 hours Spam
Not much income from our SMS but spammers. , yes “@JosephCataan:  These networks sell our numbers to those banks, real estates. Grrrrr”
Talaga? Then spam next ? “@BlissfulLiving2:  @enjoyGLOBE When you first turn on, may prompt asking for your name. for loss recovery daw”
@philippinebeat no spam SMS on Cars. Yup will blog about all these spammers  @enjoyGLOBE
@philippinebeat maybe @enjoyGLOBE does not know that there is a data privacy law. Will email an IRR to them soon
king of spam sila “@BlissfulLiving2: @momblogger @enjoyGLOBE The first spam arrived within 2 hours...Unbelievable, I got 5 spam in 24 hrs”
Improving? “@BlissfulLiving2:  @enjoyGLOBE .. a month ago. Surprisingly I haven&#39;t gotten any new spam for 2 weeks siguro. #newPrepaidSim”
They should be aware of data privacy law “@philippinebeat: . How many banks have given our contact info to call centers? @enjoyGLOBE”
@philippinebeat hmm. Before spam SMS were spam calls. Changed numbers &amp; scolded citibank . This was 10 years ago. None now
