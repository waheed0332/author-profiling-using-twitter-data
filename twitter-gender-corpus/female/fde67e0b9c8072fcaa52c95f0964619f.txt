Manachan Magan interviewing Patrick O&#39;connor - one of my all time favourites from Pat Collins What We Leave in our wake - on #wonderlust now
Talking landscape, power, human geography, rapid urbanization, interiority &amp; place. For PJ land is as yeats&#39; imaginative possessions #bns13
Things should be made as simple as possible and no simpler - Einstein as quoted by Patrick #wonderlust concepts for tired #bns13 heads
I love this idea of getting lost to find anything worthwhile, either to find an idea or a place. Loose yourself to potentiality #bns13
@aoifep aw, home already? Great to see you both Body and Soul misses you xx
Landscape contains all the answers of who we were, who we are, and who we will be #wonderlust
62,205 diff townlands in Ireland! When we loose language and our understanding of town land names do we loose our sense of place? #bns13
If we use our 5 senses in the landscape we gain a transcendent sense beyond the 5 #wonderlust #bns13

I&#39;m going back to college! ...here for the launch of the new MPhil in Creative and Cultural Entrepreneurshiphttp://4sq.com/19dIfPl&nbsp;
there are three strands on the MPhil ; Performance Arts, Visual Culture and Creative Technologies and I&#39;m doing the latter.
@TommyW I will, I can spot her behind me!
Provost Dr Patrick Prendergast talking about how creativity used to happen on the academic fringes,now it&#39;s being taken into academic centre
He talks about Ireland&#39;s native tendency to creativity but that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t improve the conditions for creativity
Now hearing from the warden at Goldsmiths. A donegal man as it happens. I&#39;m very excited about the TCD/Goldsmiths partnership
&quot;So much of the success of academic life cones when we don&#39;t prescribe outcomes&quot; Yes!
Peter Kelly from Aalto (Finland) University is today&#39;s keynote speaker on his Philosophy on Entrepreneurship Education
@PlayFairIre @jonathangrimes thank you!  Really looking forward to it
Creativity is about reaching forward not looking backwards. Business plans are fiction....
Analytical thinking, design thinking, intuitive thinking - we want a mix, business schools weight to heavily on analytics and not intuitive
The best entrepreneurs do not obey according to the rules
&quot;Creativity needs to be leadership enabled&quot; &quot;Ask why not as opposed to why&quot;
Love it :&quot;I refuse to teach classes in rooms with fixed seating&quot; Peter Kelly, Aalto Uni
@ladydotty thanks lady x
&quot;Think about positive non-conformity.&quot; I love it
Now we&#39;re hearing from Moya Doherty on creativity and entrepreneurship, who, perhaps not co-incidentally, was one of my first employers.
Good judgement takes experience, knowledge and training
Moya talking about the whole world coming to them on Capel St for rehearsals over a three week period by opening up the auditions online.
&quot;Culture is not an invisible practice, it&#39;s the cement that binds people together&quot; : Moya Doherty
Creative industries thrive on collaboration, non-hierarchial structures, flexible work hours and geographical bases
Moya talking about how govt needs to improve the technical infrastructure in Ireland - dropped calls, poor bandwidth
@she_c pretty excited all right!
The going back to college bonuses begin! http://instagram.com/p/eaDSV0RT8g/&nbsp;

Love that @GilbertLiz is a @BreneBrown fan. Should have guessed really.
EG - I like to take a crisis and try to turn it into a puzzle. A puzzle is like a crisis with the drama dialed down. It&#39;s easier to examine

I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/6FbWyxdcXEk?a&nbsp; Mount Kimbie - Made to Stray (DJ Koze Remix)
So who&#39;s #WebSummit ing today?
@ladydotty are you here lady?!
Kicking it with the tech nerds today (@ Web Summit w/ @darraghdoyle @patphelan @eimearmccormack)http://4sq.com/17wuTkJ&nbsp;
Ask yourself &quot;What does Creativity look like&quot; Understand your users.
I know it&#39;s a tech conference, ergo lots of men, but really - @verizon with the girls in heels and tight red dresses? Really #WebSummit
Hearing about the choke effect of technology &quot;paradox of choice&quot; Paradox of choice at the #WebSummit too - so much great stuff.
@PlayFairIre yes! Only for the morn today - here all day tomorrow. You?
Full house (and then some) for Nichola Mendlesson from Facebook #WebSummit
Facebook moved from 0% to 40% revenue from mobile in 18months. This is after making all their engineers retrain in mobile programming
469mlion of facebooks 751million mobile users checks daily it more often. Up to 10-14 times a day
20% of all the time people are spending on mobile is on Facebook or Instagram. ( insert fb ad here) where are the other 80%? #websummit
now a media panel debating whether we are in a golden age of content, or whether publishing is dead and no one will pay for content anymore
Panel includes digital officers from BBC, Guardian and RTE #websummit
Guardian have over 100 people working on their digital content #WebSummit
Guardian and BBC folk debating whether display based digital advertising is the future...
guardian talking about brands making different kinda of asks - more collaboration and Programme development (builds) can be 7 figure deal

Me and @ladydotty more star struck by Darina Allen popping by to say hi than anyone rise! Rocking cool glasses too
Huge congrats to @GoodFoodIreland Amazing food so far - properly Irish gourmet. Dying to get out to the dessert station outside #WebSummit
@mariadkennedy that&#39;s what I thought...
Had beautiful Xmas cake (!) from @foodsofathenry at #WebSummit and then some amazing truffle lollipops - who were they by @GoodFoodIreland ?
@PlayFairIre @bartonj interesting...or do they get a lunch break
@bartonj @PlayFairIre so disappointing
@foodsofathenry @GoodFoodIreland wow- especially good for #glutenfree I had your regular pud as my Xmas pud last year. Amazing too!
Loving the men&#39;s fashion at #WebSummit So many great looks. There should be a tech nerd street style instagram from the summit
Lost the other one of these touch screen gloves at @WebSummitHQ today and I only bought them yest! touchscreen jobs n all :-( #WebSummit
so who&#39;s all coming to #airwaves13 ?!
I liked a @YouTube video from @klaraarnalds http://youtu.be/z2xHd-OToko?a&nbsp; Boogie Trouble - Toxic (Britney Spears Cover)
@YoureOnlyMassiv love it! All the best chicks cover Toxic . That&#39;s an especially fab video tho

No two consumers should experience your brand in the same way - Personalisation on the Digital Stage #WebSummit
@neiljcapel on how to personalise your brand : 1) speak to individuals. This is hard but you have to treat them all separately #websummit
How? Converge your data sources into one but don&#39;t be afraid to have more than one data set. Needs to work in real time #WebSummit
@delphilabel thing is though I might not remember a URL. Everyone here has smart phones so it&#39;d be so easy to take a pic and bookmark
Segmentation is not personalisation Yes! #WebSummit
Your first email engagement with a new user has to be personal and reflect their unique interactions with you #WebSummit
Personalisation is customer retention. It&#39;s 5 times more cost effective to retain a customer than attract a new one #WebSummit
@delphilabel true, but hard when there are 250+ of them!
Next up &quot;top 10 Virologist&quot; @benhuh #WebSummit to talk about real time content on the digital stage
A scalable method of scaling content that takes advantage of the unique formats is a native format #WebSummit
Good point.: If you are watching tv on your devices - what is your favourite tv? iPad, laptop, iPhone? #WebSummit
Marshall Mcluan &quot;the media is the message&quot; #WebSummit
We are quickly approaching the 112 hr /week consumption method but it&#39;s heavily distributed. This fragmentation presents opportunities
Great example is Oreo pride campaign. Repurposed their brand for real time event &amp; created something hugely iconicpic.twitter.com/OkUKMdhDV8
New tv screens are getting so large that periphery vision now has to be considered by content creator! #WebSummit
Old formats did hard - vinyl sales up 740% since 2010 Good formats become specialist accuracy of figures needs to be checked! He talks fast!
When you create marketing content your competition is kitten photos. You must bet the kitten! The user can just look away
Rules: build a platform for gathering data. If you know your audience likes Pokemon then they are 25-30 so mould content accordingly
2. Focus on sharing happiness, Top 2 mainstream things to share are personal photos &amp; things that I think are funny. 73% among trendsetters
3. Pick the right native format for sharing your content. Do not view constraint as a problem. people are more creative with constraint
4. Keep commitment short. Allow people to ease their way in. 5. Co-ordinate for saturation #WebSummit
Wow. Digital advertising panel (all men) are such giddy advertisers. Like a noughties mad men. I count at least 2 cardigans! #WebSummit
@AveTeresa he also asked &quot;do you still read scrolls&quot; ?! And we do - till receipts #WebSummit
Native is today&#39;s word from the #WebSummit Digital stage
Really looking forward to @cindygallop at 11am. must see #WebSummit
In the next Quarter mobile advertising revenue will surpass desktop for Facebook for first time Mobile is the future #WebSummit
@GenLeeSpecific no, it&#39;s more about creating content (ads, programmes, creative content) specific for a device, platform etc
Your business model can be anything u want it to be.There are no rules.Figure out how you want to make money &amp; build model that serves that
You are what you measure. The new creativity is driven by data #WebSummit
If you plug innovation and inspiration into old world order businesses you&#39;ll just get same old results - no real innovation
Why do we need to redesign our business? We can&#39;t do new world order business from an old world order place #websummit #cindygallop
Humanise your approach to big data. http://Www.textsfromlastnight.com&nbsp; hilarious yet modern poetry, SMS as an art form, yet also a social document
Human beings are irrational so you have to humanise big data, and how we collect it. Complete Transparency is new world order #WebSummit
Today&#39;s marketing is co-creation, tomorrow is co-action
The new capitalism : shared value plus shared action = shared profit (financial and social)
Every time we check our email/twitter/Facebook/all notifications we are looking for &#39;little pellets of love&#39; #WebSummit
The more you (as a company) open up to your consumer the more they share with you. Build trust, want them to want you to know them!
Action: action AS marketing, not as a result of marketing.
The future of brands and tech is bound up with the future of payments.
The future is not about selling units it&#39;s about selling products, but ones of utility &amp; value delivered in way that is enormously valuable
Unilver strategy to &quot;craft&quot; brands for life in a connected world - Putting people first, building brand love, unlocking the magic #websummit
Until ever has two strategies, one for developers words and one for developing and emerging markers.
They actually make 60% of their revenue from emerging markets, and mobile is stills huge part of that
Damn twitter lost my fav Cindy gallop point (wifi keeps failing in dig stage) #WebSummit
But I think she said - the future of creativity/innovation is female. Women will question status quo because we are never it! #websummit
Well that was a giant unilever ad for 15mins.
Super packed library stage. Clearly everyone wants to know about how to create good content that people want to read #WebSummit
Wow, @HuffingtonPost has 10 million comments monthly. Lately the quality has dipped so anonymous comments are no longer being allowed
Speakers include Matt Galligan, Lyra McKee, Paul Quigley, Jimmy Maymann  James Ball, Mic Wright
Very interesting discussion about not only reporting important stories but crafting them to invoke outrage and engagement
Also talking in here about how funny is top piece of content - funny strange &amp; funny ha ha. Also emotive stories about things that matter
Anyone catch the name of the last book @timarmstrongaol reccomended?  #WebSummit

@hanly15 @timarmstrongaol @aolireland thank you!
Tony Conrad from about me talking about the positive conception of failure in the US as a key driver of innovation #WebSummit
Says he doesn&#39;t ness set out to build a brand but does think about the community it&#39;s for - users, staff, ambassadors
Not enough entrepreneurs think about the name. It has to be great, you have to get the domain and it has to be translatable
Michael lebowitz on career progression - first you affect the What ( what&#39;s being made) then as you get more senior the how we do what we do
And then finally the why - why do we do what we do #WebSummit
I love it - Tony talking about them getting the domain for about.me took 14 phone calls but the key to unlocking it was storytelling
Let me tell you about us - it&#39;s exactly what @cindygallop was talking about - open up and build trust #WebSummit
@bryanmeehan talking about the authenticity and subtlety of the @bluebottleroast brand #WebSummit
Say No! We say no all the time - we grow at the pace we want to grow at, not just because the opportunity is there.
@tonyconrad invests very early - I like founders of movements, products that capture my imagination, like @WordPress #WebSummit
Clear message coming across of getting your values straight - investors and consumers and staff respond to your values/culture #WebSummit
Argh. Sessions are frustratingly short.No time for depth.Could have listened to @kevinrose @bryanmeehan @tonyconrad for an hour #WebSummit
Now @brattray from http://change.org&nbsp; on how consumer activism online will change the way you do business #WebSummit
Neatly illustrates the new norm for transparency - teenager gets Gatorade to remove a potentially toxic chemical from Gatorade #WebSummit
While 4th grade class gets crayons to totally change their manufacturing towards recyclable markers
So what&#39;s going on? In part, democratizing access to advocacy tools creates dramatic increases in engagement
Personal stories - Huge theme of this stage, not entirely surprising as it&#39;s the digital marketing stage but interesting to see it recur
Fascinating. Shame driven change &quot;My daughter is on fb and I&#39;m embarrassed we work like that&quot; Transparency transparency transparency
@tmesis http://change.org&nbsp; driven change See here:  http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/01/29/1508851/gatorade-remove-bvo/&nbsp;…
So funny to be in the Library venue in the RDS. The first live event I ever worked on was in this room - the UCD fashion show in 1996/7
So...how many attendees are using the &#39;search by lanyard code&#39; function on the app for non-professional means? #websummit
@williewhite apparently
Great talk from 13yr old Waterford boy @CaseyGames who has already founded 2 start ups!  #WebSummitpic.twitter.com/amRYDmjfSf
His new My little world game includes pops for players to get tools to build levels His TeachWare co was launched yesterday #WebSummit
TeachWare is cloud based and free, cross platform and allows teachers to track all elements of their students and classes #WebSummit
Great thing about being a young entrepreneur? By the time I&#39;m 23 I&#39;ll have 10years experience in development #WebSummit @CaseyGames

last run through of my notes before @roughdraftsligo today. Looking forward to meeting everyone later this morning!
@ladydotty how&#39;s the voice?!
@ladydotty one final run through to do but yep...you? I seem to have developed a bloody cold though! I blame Iceland. See you soon.x
@linkedin now have 1million users in Ireland
Pauline White of @LOOKWESTie  introducing the #roughdraft13 Conf by chatting about creative west and the creative sector in the NW
Looking forward to speaking at Rough Draft today - Sligo&#39;s first Design and New Media conference for Design Week. http://www.roughdraft.eu&nbsp;
I&#39;m going to be talking about design projects for @CreativeStateNW  @modelsligo @mcoprojects @Detail_DS @MerrionSqDub #roughdraft13
Next up the amazing @ladydotty from @StarlingDigital to talk about the brilliant #sligowhoknew campaign #roughdraft13
Beautiful illustrations from @danleydon and @twoodlePip accompanying @ladydotty &#39;s talk today #roughdraft13
@anniewestdotcom @aoifep are you here for your shout out ladies? #roughdraft13
Dip in to http://www.whoknew.sligotourism.ie&nbsp; for a look at the #sligowhoknew hashtag board. Such a brilliant campaign
Nearly 2,500 Instagram pics tagged with #sligowhoknew - hugely impressive figures
Next up @FabAllThings talking about 3D printing and design at #roughdraft13
Maker movement - people hacking physical objects &amp; spaces to find new ways to be happy to be alive despite a terrible economy #roughdraft13
@FabAllThings do an open call for designs but don&#39;t take IP from the designers, they license them and pay royalties to designer
They then figure out how to fabricate the designs and sell them. Some beautiful examples shown here at #roughdraft2013
So fascinating to see the complex and beautiful designs that are possible through 3D Printing #roughdraft13 @FabAllThings
@FabAllThings are the only platform that will accept a JPEG as the design to enable non-design trained creatives to suggest new products
Next up - Karen Howley on AerTv and RGB beats #roughdraft2013
Also oops - apparently I&#39;ve been using the wrong hashtag. It should be #roughdraft2013  please adjust your sets #fail
@icanhascook thanks! Be better if I used the correct # tho ! I always go for the shortest form #roughdraft2013 #roughdraft13
hearing about changes in broadcast models - particularly w/ the advent of live streaming. AerTv have shown over 300 sporting events this yr
Biggest challenge : the internet. Love hate relationship for live streamers (and the rest of us!) #roughdraft2013
Upload rate is the main barrier. It always comes back to infrastructure -we need proper connections to be properly connected #roughdraft2013
I will never tire of the word dongle #roughdraft2013
Technology is there - You can stream with an app live to the web, but without the connection speed it won&#39;t work. #roughdraft2013
4G may mean a sea change for the possibilities of live streaming #roughdraft2013
Now for something different - Karen talking about her other project RGBeats : abstract painting to music #roughdraft2013
Great to see someone being open about their creative expression. More of this please #roughdraft2013
I&#39;m up soon - *very* thankful that the neurofen cold and flu has kicked in #roughdraft2013
Next up one of my favourite Irish start-ups, and from #sligo of course Vincent from @KovetIndustries #roughdraft2013
@magnumlady thanks val!
Kovet are part of Verus &amp; make such beautiful designed iphone cases. Verus deals largely w/ medical devices so Kovet was a consumer spin off
Kovet starred when Verus was approached to create a biodegradable, Irish made, plastic iPhone 3S case by Jivo #roughdraft2013
Kovet was born - Irish made, Irish designed, packed, produced and shipped in IRL #roughdraft2013pic.twitter.com/8CiE5Igwxm
First illustrator they approached was @chrisjudge who was hugely enthusiastic and gave them confidence to approach others #roughdraft2013
I love this start up approach. All Irish - so important. And SO possible. Creativity leads to innovation leads to growth #roughdraft2013
@ladydotty fast thumb :)
You can get Kovet cases in Vodafone, 3G etc stores, and my fave - designist on George&#39;s Street. And online of course
Kovet have just been commissioned to produce IRFU speculation edition covers for the autumn / winter season #roughdraft2013
Great question from @aoifep : How important is having an in house creative with a good aesthetic to the success of your product
Answer - hugely. Took a really long time to pin down the brand - really important for us to get that right. #roughdraft2013
They picked the iPhone simply because it was market leader in smart phones at that time. They are thinking about broadening #roughdraft2013
But every product change is a risk-even iphone5 will be a risk so samsung etc would be too.Tooling machine is an investment #roughdraft2013
One chat on Ian Dempsey on todayfm generated 100 sales in an hour So traditional media plays a huge part for @kovetindustries
They see benefits from digital marketing but don&#39;t have expertise - this is still a part time company. About 20% sales thru web
Back after a nice lunch to hear from maker Leo Scarf about his beautiful designs #roughdraft2013
@MarieBrouder thanks Marie
@_davidcollier thank you!
@_davidcollier @MerrionSqDub was designed by the brilliant @Detail_DS #roughdraft2013
@Vee_Sca even when it crashes it&#39;s worth it! My first time - a good learning
@anniewestdotcom thanks a million - never sure how interesting these things are. Glad you got something from it!
Leo Scarf&#39;s bespoke furniture designs are so beautiful, particularly the Lightweaves http://www.leoscarffdesign.com/i/Intro..html&nbsp; #roughdraft2013
The importance of setting up physical networks - like the Irish furniture designers network http://www.irish-designers.com&nbsp; #roughdraft2013
And a great point about the importance of design and education from third or el all the way to kids #roughdraft2013
Leo moved from urban Dublin to rural sligo - quite a change. I love these stories about creative people moving to #sligo and he makes the...
...point that these days it doesn&#39;t matter where you are situated, you just need broadband and a regular courier! #roughdraft2013
@RSeabrooke they&#39;re just saving the best till last....
Leo talking about the joy of an open brief, but then constraints you work to with the materials - outdoor lamps are rain and storm proof!
Love the idea of the connectable, modular products he created for creative start up hubs like The Hive and @Wayra #roughdraft2013
Leo&#39;s created a new collection called hiberform for these modular pieces. Love the idea of natural wool used in acoustic treatments
Next up @_davidcollier with his one slide wonder at #roughdraft2013 he&#39;s talking about his sound project &#39;In your Own Time&#39;
Love the idea of @_davidcollier &#39;a In your Own Time app - use of your ambient surroundings to create music http://inyourowntime.net&nbsp;
The focus is on how you, as a listener, can use your environment, and your movements to create music spontaneously #roughdraft2013
Wow- takes the tempo of your walk to affect the music, and then takes in loud sounds from your environment and records them to create music
Hugely interesting way to think about the live experience and expression of music from a maker @_davidcollier
Boo - his free app is only available on Android.Someone please get this on iPhone for @_davidcollier http://inyourowntime.net&nbsp; #roughdraft2013
@_davidcollier Great project! what are the names of those other sound projects you mentioned? Couldn&#39;t get them down!
Great work being showcased at @roughdraftsligo Seriously impressive gender balance in speakers too - take note @WebSummitHQ #roughdraft2013
Definite common thread from speakers about forming a business to suit their lifestyle needs. Making location work for them #roughdraft2013
Important point about commercialisation. It&#39;s not a dirty word, it&#39;s what allows us to keep doing what we do #roughdraft2013
Mad about t&quot;branding @designhubirl created for food store. Identity through all touch points drove 15% sales increase http://thefoodstore.ie&nbsp;
From a food store in Mayo to a Nasa and Apple endorsed piece of industrial design for stylus. Collaboration key in design #roughdraft2013
Love it - from baby gifts to portable vibrator app vibease. True flexibility of design @DesignHubIre ! #roughdraft2013
@_davidcollier thank you! Off to google I go. Great ideas you shared today - especially your own!
@colingillen @ladydotty @roughdraftsligo @awymest @anniewestdotcom thank you! And well done everyone - great great conference, inspiring!

Desperately trying to find art project mentioned at @MuseumNext Barcelona where visitors left audio recordings at art pieces in a US park?
The project might have been from @walkerartcenter or @MuseumModernArt or @smithsonian - anyone know? (see last tweet for info)  #musuemnext
@Elaine_Parsons no :-( both those are great examples of what I &#39;m researching. This one was an outdoor art trail, but the visitors left...
@Elaine_Parsons audio of how it was on their visit (rain/birds etc) and you could play their layers of experiences back when you visited.
@irishetchings that would be amazing! I &#39;ll DM you later by way of reminder so :)
