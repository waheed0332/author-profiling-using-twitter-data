you know what&#39;s awesome? the herring sandwich from Gourmet and More.  and their cheese cave, CHEESE CAVE.
#dining out: go solo, go early, go later, willingness to eat at the counter, make reservations in advance, don&#39;t be picky
Resisting urge to hop on a taxi as per Matt Reina&#39;s advice to save money.  Good advice.
finding that perfect apartment is absolutely crazy.  even crazier? dealing with two parties who want their claim of your rent check.
