&quot;A Probabilistic Method for Inferring Preferences from Clicks&quot; with Shimon Whiteson and Maarten de Rijke #cikm2011 http://bit.ly/ooA5fR&nbsp;
“@ggdupont: machine learning for IR session in #cikm2011 : first paper was great” -- Thanks! :-)
Just closed the #dir2011 demo submission. 7 demos were submitted.
This week&#39;s folia (UvA magazine) has a short piece about my research (under TECH-SHIRTS): http://issuu.com/foliacivitatis/docs/folia15_64/18
Our article &quot;Balancing exploration and exploitation in listwise and pairwise learning to rank for IR&quot; is now online http://bit.ly/I6zvg6&nbsp;  :)
Nice! One full paper and one poster accepted at #cikm2012.
@tomas_matousek things are pretty good, although not as adventurous as for you, apparently - those pics are awesome! :-)
Am I really supposed to pay twice the registration fee to present two papers at #cikm2012?
@adambermingham @breyten thanks! let&#39;s see if I can actually afford to present both the full paper and the poster ... :)
@krisztianbalog you can use \raggedright (before \bibliography...)
Interesting article about &quot;dark social&quot;:http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dark-social-we-have-the-whole-history-of-the-web-wrong/263523/#.UHrKTNeBA9Q.twitter&nbsp;…
Written by Peter Norvig more than 10 years ago, relevant as ever ... Teach yourself programming in 10 years http://norvig.com/21-days.html&nbsp;
Nice! &quot;Reusing Historical Interaction Data for Faster Online Learning to Rank for IR&quot; \w @anneschuth, @shimon8282 &amp; @mdr accepted #wsdm2013
@dvdgrs @mariahendrike why should the looks matter?
@dvdgrs @mariahendrike... Can only speak for myself, but I pick role models by what they say and do (and how they do it).
Interesting stuff &quot;@dvdgrs: &quot;Leading Environmental Activist’s Blunt Confession: I Was Completely Wrong To Oppose GMOs&quot; http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/01/03/mark_lynas_environmentalist_who_opposed_gmos_admits_he_was_wrong.html&nbsp;…&quot;

@firadl is making some last minute changes on our tutorial slides. Looking forward to the tutorial this afternoon #ECIR2013
Posted slides and additional material for our #ECIR2013 tutorial on Practical Online Retrieval Evaluation http://wp.me/p2tKD7-15&nbsp; (w @firadl)
Mark Najork about social search: 10% of bing searches are for people #ecir2013
@leifos I think i will be crucial in the future - when all our data is online. We&#39;ll search the web, personal photos, docs from one point.
@leifos creepy! Plus it&#39;ll be a perfect memory of everything you&#39;ve ever said or done.
Mark mentions &#39;private traits and attributes are predictable ...&#39; http://m.pnas.org/content/early/2013/03/06/1218772110&nbsp;… #ecir2013
Paul Ogilvie explains biases that make evaluation on LinkedIn hard: repetition, time of day, referrer... #ecir2013
Antonio Gulli about Bing: 110m unique users in the US #ecir2013
Antonio about massive data mining at Bing: cosmos and scope #ecir2013
Limitations of mapReduce - users have to manually specify execution plans #ecir2013
Karen Church: mobile search is unique - personal, context, fresh... #ecir2013
Karen: more than 50% of mobile Google searches have local intent #ecir2013
Great talk by Bottou: Large Scale Machine Learning in the Real World (Part 2) Causation and Exploration @TechTalksTV http://techtalks.tv/talks/large-scale-machine-learning-in-the-real-world-part-2-causation-and-exploration/58032/&nbsp;…
My thesis is now available:
Fast and Reliably Online Learning to Rank for Information Retrievalhttp://wp.me/p2tKD7-1X&nbsp;
Agreed, very cool! @djoerd: Daan Odijk from @commit_nl gives impressive semantic linking demo for @dwdd at #dir13. @dodijk
My first computer blew up because I forgot to unplug the power before taking it apart
#KieraWilmot
Everything&#39;s prepared and ready to go for #dir2011 tomorrow. Looking forward to an exciting day!
@edgarmeij @dvdgrs @dodijk @TomKenter congrats! :-)
@dvdgrs  it was a great day indeed!

Super excited about starting my new job today: as a postdoc with Microsoft Research Cambridge!
Just landed in Dublin. Looking forward to #sigir2013.

@n0mad_0 Thanks for pointing this out! I corrected the link, enjoy the slides :)
Very much enjoyed reading David Bodoff&#39;s reaction to &quot;the Fuhr Challenge&quot;: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2492189.2492191&nbsp;… - now, how do we conceptualize IR?
@arjenpdevries one inappropriately short summary could be: don&#39;t stop at *what* works, focus on *why* it works and *when*.
ECIR 2014 Demos can now be submitted through

@alaa_ghareeb for any demo submissions you should have received a notification. If not, please send me the submission id privately.
@iFromm @ECIR2014 :-) I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have a great audience! The prize, however, will be for the best demo.
@anneschuth congrats! I&#39;d like a camera ready copy as well.
@anneschuth goed dat jullie dit onder de aandacht brengen!
The paper I&#39;ll be presenting at #ecir2011 is now online: http://bit.ly/fHqCxT. Presentation in session 7 on Wed. April 20, 10:30.
