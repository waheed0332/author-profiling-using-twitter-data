@macmixing I thought it was directly related to iOS 7 somehow since it started happening in the first beta. Guess I need to go in.
@macmixing Well, it comes out tomorrow :P
@macmixing Really? How do they tell the difference?
@macmixing Wow, that’s stupid. Because I can’t be a developer? Fuck that.

Awful.

@CERVEZAmasFINA So buggy.

It’s been so long, peanut butter M&amp;Ms.
@RandGM Buggiest public release they’ve had. Kind of appalling. Not like them to ship something they know has so many bugs rendering the OS
@RandGM …unusable in some aspects. They were aware from beta bug reports; chose to ship anyway. Disappointing.
@RandGM I was. That wasn’t as bad as this. And, you’re right, the updates were ready to go instantly.

@JohnMetta @brennannovak @icupcake Especially since I have a 13” rMBP. Love the mini.
I dislike that after I install an update on an iOS device it automatically turns Bluetooth on.
Hot corners don’t work for me in Mavericks. Anyone else having issues?
Zelda: A Link Between Worlds may be the tipping point for me. It may be time to buy a 3DS. D:
@Vilkata That ALMOST made me get one. I was already shamelessly addicted to AC on the Game Cube back in the day.
@thebuttmaster That’s what I think I’ll get. Hoping maybe I can snag a good deal for Black Friday. We’ll see.
@chartier @danvpeterson @1Password Yes, tell Dan all of those things! And then roll your eyes at @KyleSwank. Make him feel like I’m there.
@jmattm Oh, that almost made me cave. It was very difficult. But I think now I *have* to get an XL. And get both games!
@WCHamilton Finder *is* a disaster. Oof.
Sell my 3rd gen iPad…buy a 3DS XL…

Just keeping the economy alive, one gadget at a time.
@thebuttmaster My social life will regret it…

…but I gotta do what I gotta do. Priorities, man.
@iChris @lonelysandwich @coin This sounds so dirty. 

I like it.
@JBTech17 I love my Nintendo.
I’m so much better at the sarcasm than @iChris.
@KyleSwank I’m going to have to get one now. :(
@iChris I see what you did there. 

No, really. I do.
@RyanSumo Really? My recommendations have all been 3DS XL or bust.
@RyanSumo haha. Well then.
I may have gotten impatient and just ordered a 3DS XL. 

Fml.
@thebuttmaster Oh, yes. Thank you! :)
@thisiscyril83 Nope. No time/money. I’m more a computer gamer anyway.
@thisiscyril83 Nope. Got a Retina mini. Selling my 3rd gen.
Mint has alerted me that I’ve purchased too many electronics this month. 

Whoops.
“I’ve ordered the Internet for next day shipment.” —@felixgallo 

This is an IT Crowd episode waiting to happen.
@JeffBenjam Space Gray + black Smart Cover is for winners!

Has anyone ever actually not beaten them then joined them?
@jmattm Love it.
Got my 3DS XL today (along with New Leaf and Pokemon Y). <img class="Emoji Emoji--forText" src="https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f47e.png" draggable="false" alt="
Not liking the new @iTVShowsApp as much. Especially since I can no longer hide sections (i.e. ended). Too showy. I just need info, clearly.
@tperzl Just as showy. Not as much info. No notifications or sync. :(
@tperzl Hm. Guess I’ll have to check it out again then.Those features weren’t there last I saw.
@tperzl And what I mean is, it’s the same design (no titles) and there is no way for me to manage shows I want to keep but hide.
@morphorod That too is no good. :/
I’ll still never understand the disconnect on iOS between the iPad and iPhone. Safari buttons on top on one and bottom on the other. Awful.
@gameism It’s always been like that. And it’s so awkward.
If you invite me to your party, I’ll be the one eating all of the little brown pieces out of your party mix.
@HeikeBaird Bee arr tee
@loganowitz Wait. That actually means something? Mine’s been on for years.
I think it’s good day to drink some hot chai and watch The Nightmare Before Christmas.
I totally got pulled in by Cyber Monday. My bank account is in pain.
@macmixing Hahaha. Actually none! :O
@macmixing Video games and a portable external hard drive.
I DIDN’T BUY T-SHIRTS GUYS GOSH
@hiBrie Never used a Nespresso, but I swear by my Keurig!
I may have purchased a 3.5 pound bag of Swedish Fish on Amazon. 

Don’t judge me.
Watching The Sound of Music live. Didn’t realize Bill Compton played the father. Too funny.
I still get a prize in my cereal box. http://instagram.com/p/hkF6KnIAAn/&nbsp;
Because so many asked: Cinnamon Toast Crunch. What else?
@RandGM Why Dialvetica (love the app though!) when you have LCP?
Co-working with @KarenSFreeman today. Talking about how god awful Apple’s calendar app is in iOS 7.
@jmattm I’m a Fantastical girl!
My mustache grew, you guys. http://instagram.com/p/hrq-MAoAM9/&nbsp;
@MaLindaLou Haha, yup.
New PR tactic seems to be to change the from name to “Hi Mom” to get the email read.

Joke’s on them. I delete my mom’s emails.
@joshuaschnell I’d totally read that too.
“Don’t you just want to cut a bitch sometimes?” —why I love @KarenSFreeman so much
It seems like we’ve had so many Friday the 13ths this year.
@sidoneill Really? Seems like we’ve had at least 3 or 4! I must be losing it.
I would kill for some delicious Turkish food delivery today.
@shoesmith81 I need some dolma and rose jam and veggie kebabs stat!
@jeremymeyers Huh?
@teefury My first scented shirt! I love you guys. #jamiehastoomanytshirts  http://instagram.com/p/h9FlWTIACq/&nbsp;

Desolation of Smaug with my Pops today.
The Desolation of Smaug was okay. Yes, I’m going to be that nerd that is upset at all the extraneous parts and characters added. :/
@ianpatrickhines @sidoneill I could deal with the silliness of the barrel scene. It’s Tauriel, the love story, and the entire mountain scene
@ianpatrickhines @sidoneill Yes. I think instead of adding the Tauriel bullshit, they could’ve just did the mountain scene correctly/longer.
@felixgallo POTATOS SUICIDE PACT
I’ve never had to return anything to Amazon until this year. And this year, I’ve had to return so many things due to defective/broken items.
Watch this. It’s only 7 minutes.http://vimeo.com/36470597&nbsp;
@Thatguyjoeymin Who else? ;)
@DeanPerry Pretty good. Busy. But good. How’re you, Mr. Perry?
@dbcel Not until the last 6 months. I even got a McDonalds egg sandwich without the egg a month ago. Just the bread part. Wtf.
You should be able to go to Target, buy a glass of wine, and shop. 

Shops with hops.
Thing 3 announced officially for 2014 — but *when*?! Need. http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/&nbsp;
@AyeGear Shoot me your email. I don’t seem to have it anywhere.
Dear LA friends, 

Stop complaining about the cold. I want to slap all of you, you pansies.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HDhmQuSLRg&nbsp;…
Double checking is iffy. Triple checking is a no.
@hiBrie @ItsMattRVA I’m working!
@hiBrie @ItsMattRVA Yes.
I realize today is the Airing of the Grievances, but…damn, Twitter.
@richburroughs Coffee regret?
“Mashed potatoes is kind of like frosting for vegetables.” –@HeikeBaird
Talking in doge meme with @HeikeBaird  all night. 

Such amuse. Much funny.
@HeikeBaird Dead to me.
It’s been a very doge Christmas.
@HeikeBaird WHAT DOES THE DOGE SAY
Anyone else used to play that free Chex FPS for PC in the 90s?
Ahh, Christmas! The day of the epic regeneration of a great time traveller.
@Turdhat The Beetus.
@HeikeBaird In case you somehow missed it:http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/millions-of-dogecoins-stolen-in-apparent-heist&nbsp;…
@TheRealJoshuaD I thought I was the only one! Yessss! 

However, never tried the Mr. Pibb one.
That moment when your boyfriend gives you a Christmas gift and it’s literally marked NSFW. 

#soulmate
@ericleamen Got the exact one recently. <img class="Emoji Emoji--forText" src="https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f44d.png" draggable="false" alt="

I think I’m finally going to order a Google Chromecast.
So, Apple gave me two gifts for day two of their 12 Days Of Gifts promotion. 

Mistake?
@michelledeidre @Marvel Very calender. Much mistake. Wow.
@Pantysnawad A show and now an app.
@TheRealJoshuaD I have an Apple TV. Wanted something portable. For traveling.
@KyleSwank Me too. Just want something portable for travel.
@jasonspooner Good call!
@gameism For now, very few. But more than those two.
@jim_napier No. :( We have how to ditch your PC for an iPad though. ;) We mainly only do iOS.
@KyleSwank Oh, he’d love that.
@iChris Real Life: Who uses Find My Friends?
@SteveStreza Oh god. Oh god no.
@CoreyTamas All of your tweets are now read aloud using the face you’re making in your avatar. Tone included. 

You’re welcome.
@CoreyTamas You’re ruining this for me.
@iChris Ah, that makes sense I guess.
Nothing says Christmas time quite like watching Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit.
@shoesmith81 I never read Harry Potter. And didn’t like the 2 movies I saw. :(
@KyleSwank I have been, yes!
Seeing all the entitled, whiny brats complain about the gifts Apple is giving away for free for the 12 Days Of Gifts is unbelievable.
@KyleSwank Yes! Did you?
@RayneBradley I have. A couple years ago, AppAdvice did a similar thing where we gave away a lot of awesome stuff (including some iPhones).
@RayneBradley 60% of the folks bitched, so we decided never to do it again. We put so much money and work into it. It was so sad.
@Flattuss Fucking exactly.
@DeanPerry I did. Did you, Mr. Perry?
@KyleSwank Sounds like a win Christmas to me.
@AndyNico_ Probably me! :P
@ItsMattRVA Private account, god dammit!?
@AndyNico_ Hashtag all baby photos with #MuteThisJamie, imo.
@AndyNico_ Lol!
@AndyNico_ Thank you. I am glad we worked this out in plenty of time.
@ItsMattRVA I feel so awful old school RTing…
@ItsMattRVA …it makes me feel dirty.
@ItsMattRVA AND IT’S TOO LONG TOO 

FUCK YOU MATT
@ItsMattRVA So selfish. I mean really.
@ItsMattRVA :)
@HeyVeronica Put velcro on your clothing and on the remote. Never lose remote again.
@JINX o.O
@JINX So tempted to send forwards.
@MikeIsaac Like…tea bags? Loose tea? Brewed tea?
@AndyNico_ @DeanPerry @christyxcore Or just post it all on Facebook. Where it belongs. (AKA: Why Jamie quit.) ;)
Oh, god. Oh, god. 

https://vine.co/v/h9PBY0Z2DIz&nbsp;

Can’t. Un. See.
@sidoneill OH MY GOD STOP
@JeffBenjam I, too, have rage for me.
I just made a huge cup of hot cocoa and put four Hershey kisses in it—and no one can stop me!

I love being an adult.
@macmixing FOUR
@macmixing I just noticed your new avatar. Perfect.
I’m still waiting for the Tweetbot 3 update that will fix the gestures and other shit they messed up in the new release.
I just realized my Instagram feed is more full of animals than people. I approve.
ME: Do I actually have to put pants on for this party tonight? @ray_ob1: I’ll be ripping them off at midnight, so don’t bother.
My new year’s resolution is 2048x1536.
Drunken politics. @KodyJGMcGee is on his soapbox. We’re just laughing.
Going outside now to bang pots and pans and yell drunkenly about 2014. Just to trip people out.
We have whiskey up the nose, folks!
Let’s not get too excited about steak and shake into thousand 14. 

Thanks, Siri.
I’m just pizza.
Going out in the same clothes I wore last night because yolo.
@nateboateng What even
I want to know why you ladies are so obsessed with this EOS lip balm. It’s more waxy than moisturizing; ends up drying my lips out more.
@hiBrie Or…I just never buy it again and stick to Burt’s Bees and C.O. Bigelow. <img class="Emoji Emoji--forText" src="https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f44d.png" draggable="false" alt="
If you can’t find what you’re looking for 

→ MAKE IT.
I got my first grid-it today. No idea why I waited so long. Anything to make my life easier and more organized.
@SpaceCatPics Psstt. Don’t retweet a bunch of someone else’s tweets. That’s not why we follow you.
I am surrounded by so many external hard drives right now.
