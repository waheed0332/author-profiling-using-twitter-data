Can&#39;t wait to meet @DCFashionGal for a #HelpMeSave grocery trip tomorrow AM! Thanks @Valpakcoupons &amp; @savings for making this possible!
I&#39;m here w/ @DCFashionGal for a special Saturday morning grocery shopping trip at @GiantFoodSC! #helpmesave
Coupons can be found in-store. Look for manufacturer coupons directly on products, on displays, tear pads &amp; blinkie machines #HelpMeSave
Also look for seasonal coupon booklets near the front of store or at customer service desk! #HelpMeSave
@GiantFoodSC allows certain types of coupon stacking. 1 non-product specific store coup + manufacturer coup on 1 itemhttp://bit.ly/17ev5BG&nbsp;
Follow sales cycles &amp; stock up when these items are loss leaders #HelpMeSave
Best way to save on groceries? Plan out your meals based on key ingredients in your pantry, or that are on sale/have coupons #HelpMeSave
Set a #NeverPayMoreThan price, so you know what a good deal is. Stock up when items, especially meats, are at or below price #HelpMeSave
Simple tip: never shop when you are hungry. Inevitably you&#39;ll add a couple extra items to your cart! #HelpMeSave
Make sure to check your receipt for price discrepancies while still in-store. It&#39;s easier to address issues before leaving #HelpMeSave
Thanks @ValpakCoupons @Savings for orchestrating this #HelpMeSave grocery trip w/ @DCFashionGal this morning!!
Had fun shopping w/ @dcfashiongal! Thanks @valpakcoupons @savings for making this possible! #helpmesavepic.twitter.com/zffGrdNEi2
