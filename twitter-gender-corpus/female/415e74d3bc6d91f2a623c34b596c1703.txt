@CBSNews Why don&#39;t the guys get it.  In prison, having your pants &quot;sagged&quot; means they&#39;re available.  Guess these fashionistas are available.
@marisabirns In prison &quot;sagging&quot; means you&#39;re available.  Guess he&#39;s more than willing
Don&#39;t understand people who continuously breed horses for that perfect one. Where&#39;s the rest? Tired of the overflow at the feedlots!
Irresponsibility has resulted in the increase in slaughter.  Have you ever seen what really happens to the horses?
Imagine a horse screaming in fear while being dunked in scalding hot water to remove the pelt.  Now keep breeding without a conscience.
@kirstiealley I look forward to your show.  Best times I have watching TV.  Thank you.  Your energy is so welcomed.  I love the laughs
Yahoo... taxes done ahead of time!
@michellemalkin This is suppose to be a grown man running our country and he&#39;s an insecure, immature baby blaming others.  Major dilusion
Our latest rescue, 20ish yr old guy who was scheduled to die, has settled in great.  Has his own band.
Hauling our latest rescue back to the ranch we blew the transfer case and had to be towed. Need donations so bad.  Equipment failing
