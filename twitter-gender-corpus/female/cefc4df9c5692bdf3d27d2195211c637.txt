@DrRubidium I do not miss winter in Nebraska.
At #HHDCSymp learning about FGF21 and diabetes. Promising new area for treatment
FGF21 makes white fat act like brown fat. #HHDCSymp
@bam294 @drisis @MTomasson EXCUSE ME?????
@drisis @bam294 @MTomasson I&#39;ve never done diddly squat with stem cells. Of course, I&#39;m no longer funded...
@bam294 @drisis @MTomasson Bourbon with stem cells...isn&#39;t that what starts the zombie apocalypse?!
FGF21 effects are NOT CNS-mediated. Yay! No brainer!
Adiponectin required for FHF21 effects. #HHDCSymp
@bam294 He&#39;s been educated today.
FGF21 andGLP1 have synergistic effects on body weight via loss of adipose tissue. Lowers intake and raises energy expenditure #HHDCSymp
Almost time for the research award reception. Great keynote by Andrew Adams of Lily.
En route to COMO for #MizzouHomecoming vs South Carolina. Hope the streak continues.

For next hour will be live tweeting the Hamm Lecture in Diabetes Research #HammLect given by Peter Bennett.
Inaugural Hamm Prize, like Nobel for diabetes research. #HammLect &quot;American Indian Contribution to Understanding ... Type 2 Diabetes&quot;
Peter Bennett&#39;s natural history studies of the Pima Tribe in Arizona have provided much of our understanding of onset of DM2. #HammLect
Remote feed to Chickasaw nation as well. #HammLect
“@Jezebel: Hot right now: letting your newborn keep his placenta for six days http://bit.ly/1gVyCOu&nbsp;”
Video intro with jurors discussing importance of body of work. Linked obesity and DM2. #HammLect
Ends with discussion of next generation of researchers. I hope they can get funded. #HammLect
1960s: &quot;Adult onst&quot; DM seen as milder form that ran in families. #HammLect
Bennett trained in Rheumatology. Came to US to do arthritis survey among Pimas living in hot dry climate. #HammLect
Found rheumatoid in Pima despite climate, plus lots of DM. #HammLect
1965: Set up center for NIH in trailers on Gila reservation. Began health survey. #HammLect Found DM prevalence 8-fold &gt; rest of world.
1976 demonstrated bad outcomes with diabetic pregnancy. #HammLect
Pima studies gave us international criteria for diagnosis of DM2. #HammLect
Association of DM and obesity documented 1981. #HammLect
Established hyperinsulinemia as risk factor for development of DM2. NOT INSULINOPENIA! #HammLect
Bennett gave Lilly Lecture at ADA in 1977. #zombies
1982: CRC in Indian Health Center allowed sophisticated metabolic studies such as clamps. #HammLect
Separate Pima population in Mexico with higher activity, less obesity and diabetes.  Heard this presented at ADA in 1992 #HammLect
Gestational DM offspring had 70% prevalence of DM by 30 years of age. #HammLect
Same mother, pre-DM offspring 30% risk! post-DM infant 70%. Points to intrauterine environment. #HammLect
Also documented increased DM risk with low and high birth weight. #HammLect
Also demonstrated protective effect of at least 2 months of exclusive breast feeding. #HammLect
Documented DM2 in adolescent, young adult Pimas. Separated DM 1 and 2 by mechanism rather than age of onset. #HammLect
Pathways to early onset DM2. Bennett 2004. Figure to pull. #HammLect
High risk of vascular complications especially CKD with early onset. #HammLect
Epidemiology of complications study with Kelly West, faculty member at OUHSC. #HammLect
Identified bp as risk factor for progression of retinopathy, nephropathy. #HammLect
All excess mortality occurred in patients with proteinuria. Now shown in other populations as well. #HammLect
2005: link of complications with periodontal disease. #HammLect
Albuminuria is clearly a bad outcome marker in DM2. #HammLect
Lifestyle interventions as successful in Pimas and other Native American populations as in general populations. #HammLect
Without Pima studies, we wouldn&#39;t know a whole lot of stuff about DM2. #HammLect
What an utterly amazing career. #HammLect

First up 
Patrick Archdeacon On the origins and operations of #KHI #kidneywk13
#KHI coalition of society, FDA and industry to address kidneys. Pilot project on end points of lupus for tris. #kidneywk13
Now presenting results of pilot project. Lupus nephritis end points. Lupus nephritis trials network + #KHI #kidneywk13
Focus on investigator initiated trials and long term follow up.  #LNTN #KHI #kidneywk13
Goals: evidence based end points for lupus nephritis and definitions of subtypes (refractory, severe) #KHI #LNTN #kidneywk13
Showing recent lupus trial end points; all over the place... #KHI #kidneywk13
Comparisons across trials impossible. #KHI #kidneywk13
Including FDA brings in other end points such as lupus flares, CKD etc. #kidneywk13 #KHI
Lit review for end points showed under representation of black, Hispanic patients in lupus trials. #KHI #kidneywk13
&quot;I know you can&#39;t read this&quot;...   AACK! My eyes! Why are you showing me stuff like this? May as well be in comic sans...
Creatinine criteria often based on entry level, not pre-flare baseline. #kidneywk13 #KHI
Duration of response may warrant inclusion as response criteria in lupus. #KHI #kidneywk13
Partial renal response not good enough; same ESRD progression as non responders. #kidneywk13 #KHI
Process and projects ahead for #KHI #kidneywk13
#KHI criteria: health need, involves multiple members, could improve health, clear deliverable. #kidneywk13
#KHIpic.twitter.com/PGPfArTX2i
After submission comes member comment period; standard online discussion board. #KHI #kidneywk13
Subcommittee review and score, followed by vote of full board. #KHI #kidneywk13
After approval call for workgroup members. Including patients! #kidneywk13 #KHI
Currently 9 projects in comment/review process in #KHI   #kidneywk13
Deliverables include standards, workshops, and white papers. #KHI #kidneykw13
Consensus on clinical trial end points is focus of a number of pending proposals in #KHI #kidneywk13
Wow. Much more pressed with #KHI now that I know what it does. #KidneyWk13

Love MU Football app for keeping me up on the game while I&#39;m at #kidneywk13 doing professional stuff #MIZZvsUK
Some tweeple have also provided football updates while I&#39;m hanging with my pee-ple. #kidneywk13
Panel of #KHI stakeholders now beginning. #kidneywk13
@KnittingNephron Planning evening near a screen, even though Mizzou will be done (and victorious).
#KHI has facilitated cross communication among members about work already in progress, use of existing data sets. #kidneywk13
Another goal: transparent infrastructure to facilitate collaboration. #KHI #kidneywk13
Room perhaps half filled. Actually a bit chilly. #firstworldproblems #neverhappy

@KnittingNephron Yup. Now I&#39;m shivering. And never happy.
Proportion of hypertensive adults controlled with meds doubled over 20 years. #kidneywk13
28% of uncontrolled hypertensive patients on3+ meds. CKD, obesity frequent. #kidneywk13
Pseudo resistant Htn: suboptimal adherence, measurement artifact (white coat). #kidneywk13
Resistant Htn has high rate of sleep apnea in part through volume redistribution. #kidneywk13
Preferred combinations: ACE or ARB plus diuretic or calcium channel blocker. #kidneywk13
Fourth bp drug should be spironolactone if tolerated. #kidneywk13
Anti hypertensive therapy a major driver of costs of cardiovascular disease. #kidneywk13
Combination of ACEI and thiazide may be best first line treatment for primary hypertension. #kidneywk13
