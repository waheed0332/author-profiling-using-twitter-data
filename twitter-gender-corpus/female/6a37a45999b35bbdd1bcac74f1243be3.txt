 #omhg
A great logo is the face of the brand. It sets the mood for what to expect.
 #omhg
YES! RT @anile: great logo = unique, personal but accessible, versatile, adaptable, also will grow with you - not limiting :) #omhg
@myCHILDish your Visual Toolbox post is awesome. Will be sharing with all my #writer clients as a reference! #omhg
@embergrass that made me think of the Method brand. Love for the same reason, simple + fits the products: http://methodhome.com&nbsp; #omhg
@ohmyhandmade A consistent photo style is SOOO important, especially for products. #omhg
@ohmyhandmade LIGHTING, LIGHTING, LIGHTING! Badly lit photos are worse than no photo! #omhg
+1 RT @embergrass: The background of the photo can be so powerful either to make or break the brand and enhance or hide the product #omhg

@RobinLNorgren LOL, I&#39;ll have to start doing that too (well after my writing session... I only get 30 minutes!).

@enderawiggin Me too, but I&#39;m pushing through anyway. Do you wanna do a 20 minute #word scrim with me? #NaNo
@figandpepper I totally thought the SAME thing! What, did someone blackmail the Republican party into picking lame candidates?
Okay, the projections sorta freak me out; I want to be excited but part of me is like- don&#39;t count your chickens til the votes are all in.
@Chookooloonks That&#39;s exactly how I feel. I was just asking hubs if I&#39;m the only one who remembers the Gore- Bush campaign?
Darn it... too much election excitement. I&#39;ve written four sentences so far for my #NaNo, #flashmo tonight.

Hey @chicmodern how&#39;s it going today? Cold here in the ATL... with light snow (not sticking, thank goodness!)
Interesting discussion yesterday about boys reading books featuring girls; mostly made me realize the feminist movement needs rebranding.
I AM a feminist. &amp; I love high heels, cute dresses, think highly of men who deserve respect, &amp; support moms who want to stay home...
Maybe I&#39;m naive, but I think there are more feminists like me than the ones who hate men or think women need to become men.
I&#39;m inclined to think feminists like me just aren&#39;t as likely to get press coverage; militant makes for better headlines &amp; ratings.
@brunettefoodie I think women like us need to become more public, and give a new face to the movement.
@brunettefoodie Definitely!
@brunettefoodie I think that a lot of women fight behind the scenes but don&#39;t like the connotation of feminist so don&#39;t claim it.

@ShoshannaEvers do u think this is censorship? Personally i don&#39;t wanna hear how ppl feel about the author, just if the book is a good read.
@ShoshannaEvers so if a person decides they dislike u, say for ur politics, it&#39;s ok with u that they include that in a book review?
@ajalbinak i dunno, i think ur words should stand for themselves. Otherwise there&#39;s tons of great literature I&#39;d have never read.
@ajalbinak @ShoshannaEvers I&#39;m definitely that way with music/movies/theater. Guess I give books more leeway.
@ohmyhandmade hello lovely lady! Just wanted to thank u for how kind u were when my sis passed last yr. I still appreciate u so much 4 that!
@ShoshannaEvers i like the no bangs, but the bangs feel like ur signature look to me. :)

@chicmodern ugh, I hate when apps do that. If they want it to be an option, you should have to turn it on, not turn it off.
@chicmodern I&#39;m good, just took a break from social media for a bit. The phone was becoming part of my hand! How are you?

@caracabe hey, me too! Decided to work on flash fiction... better to be writing something regular, than not writing. #amwriting #flashmo
Good Morning Tweeps and Happy Friday! We survived a hurricane this week, I think we all deserve a good weekend...
Instead of #NaNo, I&#39;m doing #FlashMo. It&#39;s like Nano for writers with short attention spans: http://buff.ly/SucrPE&nbsp;

There is no rhyme or rhythm to my selection &amp; those I kill often die with a question in their eyes. #flashmo #amwriting http://wp.me/p1VegZ-7f&nbsp;
@meganmonique That&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m doing my modified version of #NaNo. I love my branding/promo work but I still NEED to write for myself.
@pinkbagels on behalf of family members who do not notice stinky garbage, I cry &quot;but I DIDN&#39;T smell it!&quot; (my hubby would sympathize w/ you)
@RobinLNorgren LOL, I&#39;ll have to start doing that too (well after my writing session... I only get 30 minutes!).
@LeighPeterson She&#39;s a writer named Jamie Arindaeng and she needs a V.A. to help with a book launch.
@thinkbip LOL... same age as Ian. He&#39;s gonna love that!
@redneckmommy &lt;3 That&#39;s classic!
Keeping seeing #NaNo counts and feeling a little jealous. Must remember the fact I&#39;m writing daily is what&#39;s important. #amwriting #flashmo
Okay back to work... focus now so I have time to #write later.

Anyone up for a writing sprint? Starting at the :40 for 30 minutes. #nano #flashmo
Sprint done! My 8 yr old did 160 words and I finished my 2nd #flashmo. No word count yet cause I wrote longhand. How&#39;d ya&#39;ll do? #amwriting
You know what&#39;s even better than doing a word sprint with my baby boy? When he decides to keep writing when the time is up.
He told his daddy &quot;I&#39;m writing my #nano book so don&#39;t be loud.&quot; #ProudMama

Hmm...maybe I need to hand write all my sprints. Finally typed up and published my #flashmo for today and it was 799 words! #amwriting #NaNo
@NaNoMusical I &lt;3 this so much!  Ya&#39;ll are awesome!  :)
@ANNELAMOTT That perfectly sums up the miracle of grace.

So still need to write my #nano #flashmo for the day. Anyone wanna suggest a topic or starting sentence? #amwriting

Word #scrim done but I don&#39;t feel good about what I wrote :(

{stories – #Flashmo} Hitting the wall and the untitled story http://dlvr.it/2RKZzz&nbsp;
I&#39;ve been avoiding social media today... don&#39;t want to hear any last minute political commentary.  Still, I miss my tweeps!
Ugh, this is nail biting time!  I was trying so hard not to watch the news, but I can&#39;t ignore it...
@amberla LOL... stop it, you made me choke, I laughed so hard!
@enderawiggin Me too, but I&#39;m pushing through anyway. Do you wanna do a 20 minute #word scrim with me? #NaNo
@figandpepper I totally thought the SAME thing! What, did someone blackmail the Republican party into picking lame candidates?
Okay, the projections sorta freak me out; I want to be excited but part of me is like- don&#39;t count your chickens til the votes are all in.
@Chookooloonks That&#39;s exactly how I feel. I was just asking hubs if I&#39;m the only one who remembers the Gore- Bush campaign?
Darn it... too much election excitement. I&#39;ve written four sentences so far for my #NaNo, #flashmo tonight.
@chicmodern Celebration dinner?
@BritniDWrites The popular vote is so close, you had to know it was gonna happen!
@SisterDiane Me too.
{stories – #Flashmo} This story was interrupted by the elections http://dlvr.it/2RdlrJ&nbsp;
@chicmodern I love that! :)
@artofdoingstuff Liked and RTing... :)
@Chookooloonks Yes, that back and forth 1% gives me knots in my stomach.
Okay, I&#39;m old and I have work in the A.M... I&#39;m going to bed with my fingers crossed that all the predictions will be facts in the A.M.
Anyone else excited that we may see the U.S. expand to 51 states? Never thought that would happen during my lifetime: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/49714785#.UJnvLo7w620&nbsp;…
@adamlevine OMG! Just said the same thing to hubby... gays, abortions, that&#39;s old hat... but you should never mess with Big Bird!
Ok, really, I&#39;m going to bed now.
@HilaryRushford that&#39;s why politics sucks overall... someone always has to lose.
I think it&#39;s a good concession speech, love his bit about his wife &amp; the desire for politicians on both sides to put people before politics.
@AstridEndeavor Yeah, just had to wait it out! lol
@littlebrownjen yeah, I thought it was classy.
Ok, it&#39;s gotta suck to lose and then listen to people naysay your future in life too. #helostletitgo
Happy afternoon guys! Am I the only one who feels hungover after last night? (And I didn&#39;t touch a drop!)
