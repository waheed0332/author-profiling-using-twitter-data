@chartier Nope, Mini
@Objective_Neo t’s free with a new mac/ios device i think?
Downloading Mavericks now
I truly enjoy seeing my Blaziken kick a Glaceon in the face.
@davidcaolo what year?
I&#39;ve been out today but been installing Mavericks. Finally have some time to give it a spin.
@makaed yeah, I can&#39;t imagine being without my Fitbit now
@nathansnelgrove Why?
@nathansnelgrove My mom has been wanting an iPad for a while (not sure why, really, she can barely handle her iPhone 4), so she&#39;s getting it
@nathansnelgrove my iPad 3, I mean. Ran out of characters. She&#39;s getting my hand down when I get my iPad mini
@nathansnelgrove oh, yes she is
@nathansnelgrove she&#39;s been wanting one and I don&#39;t think she needs the latest and greatest so she seemed pretty happy about it
I accidentally hit “Don’t Allow” for Fantastical in Mavericks. Now I can’t get it to access my calendars. Is there a way to change this?
@superpixels I’ve unchecked and checked it and nothing shows up still :(
Great can&#39;t even enjoy mavericks because I clicked the wrong button on one thing
@superpixels rebooting now..
@waynedixon http://d.pr/6VlR&nbsp;
Rebooted, checked off Calendar access in Privacy, still seeing nothing in Fantastical. Omfg.
Deleted Fantastical and emptied trash. App Store isn&#39;t letting me download Fantastical, says it&#39;s &quot;Installed...&quot;
@hrbrt Where do I go to delete prefs?
@LScottSpencer You misunderstood my original tweet.
So I deleted the Fantastical prefs. Open App Store. Still says Fantastical is installed. Seriously? WTF.
@nategorby I’ve restarted like four times....
Took about an hour but I finally got the Mac App Store to let me download Fantastical again.
Then I saw that it wasn’t given access to Reminders, so I checked that off (and Calendars for good measure), and now it works.
That was an infuriating hour, thanks MAS.
Just not sure why it kept thinking it was installed when I didn’t have a secondary drive plugged in…
I kind of love this feature where you can push directions directly to an iOS device.
@wondroushippo Probably too early to tell but I would think that both will be similar.
@AndyNico_ For new Macs
@viticci They get all the good things.. :(
@HueMenu I got it fixed though
@mohdabdurraafay I’m getting the iPad mini Retina next month. Been waiting for it since they came out with the mini.
@jurvistan mine too. @NSDelToro
@NSDelToro Don’t know. Maybe. But my MacBook Pro still runs fine for what I need it for...
I&#39;m not sure I like the new cross fade animation on 7.0.3 but then again that could just be because I was used to the zooming transition.
Finally, I have Salamence. Also, Noivern is awesome.
@MichaelMidnight Because it&#39;s way faster.
@MichaelMidnight New Macs?
If you found your Flux app not compatible with Mavericks, make sure to check here: http://d.pr/fcf0&nbsp;
@craigbooker Try CaptureAudio, I like that onehttp://d.pr/PXJG&nbsp;
@mikeyasalazar confirmed?
Aw, the Fitbit app got rid of the transparency that I liked :(
@robinrhys You stole my colors
Just set up my HiRise for iPhone, it’s pretty slick.
@sofiaflevin I do too @jeffreymann
@craigbooker Yep:http://d.pr/Luzr&nbsp;
I don’t understand how people like this can exist and feel nothing about ithttp://d.pr/gmXe&nbsp;
So I must be “technically illiterate” or “old” because I use OS X, right?http://d.pr/i/9HNT&nbsp;
@iGriever Definitely! :)
@drewmck completely, all of us OS X users are clueless duh
Sweet, got an Adamant natured Mawile from @NOOBOCITY
Since I updated the @automatic app today, it now won&#39;t process my latest trip, keeps failing. Filed a report.
@sethclifford it&#39;s just making the ocean into a waterfall
@davidcaolo people still care about Office?
@pixelpowa I stopped caring about that show like 2 weeks ago
@rrea83 I stopped playing before Pokemon
@rrea83 I had the Beautiful ordinance in effect so I don’t really need to worry about that I think
I can’t believe how good American Horror Story Coven was tonight.
Had to revert back to the App Store version of OmniFocus. Oh god, what is this
IM+ Pro7 is a good option if you’ve been waiting for an updated IM client. My review:http://d.pr/dlqR&nbsp;
@DejahDesignz That apps for iOS
@Failgunner Yeah
@DejahDesignz that’s not how i read it lol
Strike Wing by @CM_Games is a pretty awesome space combat simulator. I also have an extra copy to give away!http://d.pr/8KQe&nbsp;
My @automatic seems so picky about what constitutes a hard acceleration. It beeps almost every time eve though I don&#39;t &quot;step on it.&quot;
What a hypocritehttp://d.pr/i/CWLS&nbsp;
@macguitar Hah, figures that I’d see something like this when I take a look after we just talked!http://d.pr/i/4Hfu&nbsp;
@jamesmakeswords Fantastical
I really love going through iTunes reviews to see everyone’s sense of entitlement shine through
@gneoday Hey, I’m interested in checking out your app for review on AppAdvice? Is it possible to get a code? Let me know, thanks!
@jamesmakeswords Nope
Let’s have Tweetbot 3 already, please
@EvaGiselle or sugar to go with our wifi
@Dexwell_ I hate you
@jamesmakeswords Ditto
I really like the Dexter design on Shirtpunch today but I really wish it didn’t have to associate itself with the god awful finale.
Tweetbot 3!https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone/id722294701?mt=8&nbsp;…
I just clicked “Buy” so fast on that one
@loqheart Did you see the design though? it’s so beautiful. But it just HAD to include “I Survived Tropical Storm Laura” omg
@loqheart LUMBERJACK DEXTER LOLZ
@loqheart this was the designhttp://d.pr/i/xeOq&nbsp;
@loqheart Ah. Yeah, same.
This is so awesome
I’m a bit sad that I can’t change the text size, though.
@HereIsTrev Thanks! Changed it
@drewmck Dynamic text settings? That’s the only way to change it.
@rmlewisuk Yeah, already figured that out
@ronnielutes It’s dynamic text settings in iOS settings
@ronnielutes yeah
@joshuaschnell @superpixels dear* god this is genius &gt;_&gt; damn autocorrect..
Totally missed the Teefury shirts yesterday, so I had to have the Loki “Asgardian Absinthe” shirt in the After Hours sale.
@francistan Yeah, I lost interest in it.
Just got my Fitbit Force.
Like drinking diet sodas? You’ve been drinking E. Coli feces. http://d.pr/kMJi&nbsp;
I always hated diet sodas, every single kind. They taste like shit, because they’re sweetened with shit. Makes sense.
@RealZenfar I’ve literally been drinking nothing but water lately.
I haven’t even had coffee in about a week. Lately all I drink is water.
@RealZenfar But I should probably start taking up tea again.
@maguay And now we know why
@maguay They’re all mostly made from high fructose corn syrup. That’s already bad in itself
@davidcaolo yep
Love it when @Charter goes down.
And lovely when tmobile starts acting up toohttp://d.pr/i/1UEY&nbsp;
The Fitbit Force band seems pretty difficult to get on for me -_-
Absolutely in love with Oceanhorn right now. My review:http://d.pr/gUbU&nbsp;
I’m also addicted to Tilt to Live 2: Redonkulous:http://d.pr/Jvn9&nbsp;
@ellebetz What do you have against Doctor Who?
@ellebetz It’s a series you have to start from the beginning to understand what’s going on. Not really something you just jump into.
@ellebetz yeah, well, that’s the problem.
@ellebetz Yeah, only my favorite show of all time.
@ellebetz I don’t think judging an entire series based off some random episodes you come across is exactly fair, but whatever.
@ellebetz I’m just saying you’re making judgments without even giving it a chance. Don’t know why you’re being so offended by it.
@ellebetz Didn’t realize that defending what I like is such a crime.
The Night of the Doctor, a six minute short that preludes the upcoming Day of the Doctor. So amazing. http://d.pr/daeM&nbsp;
After watching the Night of the Doctor minisode, I wish we had a season with Paul McGann as the Doctor.
@andrewbg PS4
@thomascastel Still a fun game.
@thomascastel …why not both? I’m getting the Zelda game next week as well but still enjoying this one, lol
@NSDelToro It took me like two days to sign up on the California one o_O
So I unfriended someone on Facebook a few months ago, and they only found out tonight. They didn’t take it well.
@NSDelToro well I couldn’t do anything the first day, then I tried the next day or the day after without too much problems
@NSDelToro as of late it’s been okay, can’t get online help though lol
@NSDelToro Yeah the signing up was the hard part when it launched
@Live_Wire64 Exactly!
Getting tired of this mailman who keeps delivering my check to some other house and I don’t get it until a few days later.
@naveen_pcs I live in a condo so there are mailboxes in the front. My check has gone to the wrong place several times already.
@naveen_pcs I found it today in a crumpled up envelope.
Going to spend the night attempting to cook some barramundi fish with @NOOBOCITY.
@erondu That’s from Legend of Korra
@erondu I loved that line lol
@thevixy what?!?
Bored with this episode of #TheWalkingDead. Really? You’re trying to make me feel bad for the guy?
Something awesome better happen at the end of this otherwise what a huge waste of time *yawn* #TheWalkingDead
I’m still waiting to see how Daryl reacts to the news of Carol, tbh #TheWalkingDead

Pokemon Origins really deserved more than four episodes. Red is a much better character than Ash. Sigh.
@TimOliverAU Ash is also a stupid character who will never achieve anything and slows down all his companions.
@TimOliverAU He gives away all of his Pokemon and his companions become successful after they stop traveling with him. How is that not bad?

@plinske Whoa, that’s pretty awesome
@AndyNico_ You don’t know about @Hatch?
The controls in Touchgrind 2 are frustrating, or maybe because I don’t know a thing about skateboarding.
Got my fugu’s trust to 100…now what? Hmmm
@krosenbluth you convert star fruit into them when the shop is open

Pet peeve with @instagram: when someone uploads a video of a concert and I am on it for a quick second and it starts BLARING at full volume.
Watching Adventure in Time and Space. Ugh can’t wait for Day of the Doctor!
That was an awesome cameo at the end of An Adventure in Space and Time.
7 minutes! #SaveTheDay
Geronimo!
Holy shit that was amazing #DoctorWho50th
@dannyrodri I agree!!!!
Peter Capaldi, tho
Catching up on MLP now
Nightmare in Silver is on, bye
@rrea83 Can’t wait! He looks like he’s going to be awesome!
Watching the rest of The End of Time on BBC. It’s ok, I didn’t need these feels anyway.
I saw Catching Fire. I liked it, but I got lazy and didn’t finish the book yet. Didn’t like that ending though..
So….next week will be another “big clash” at the prison? This will be what, like 3 times or something? #TheWalkingDead
So tired of The Governor. #TheWalkingDead
@davidcaolo I just want to know how Daryl reacts to the Carol news and I want to know what the sickness is, etc. ughhhh
@tinrocket Would love to check it out for review! :) @WaterlogueApp

@phillryu Not now, but saved in Instapaper lol
@codyfink I left it with Beautiful Ordinance
Completed Christmas shopping, saw anchorman 2 again, and had dinner. Not bad.
I enjoyed Anchorman 2 even more on the second time.
@SandynLos The email I got only said debit or Chase Liquid cards
@SandynLos Yeah, same for debit cards.
My iPhone 5s re-sprang twice in the last hour. That must be some kind of new record. 1st by returning to home screen, 2nd searching for app.
@tanmays Yeah, I know.
@tawee I don’t jailbreak
@hotdogsladies One of the greatest episodes ever
@bitario yeah I’ve been getting app updates and I was wondering what the heck? Lol
@dannyrodri nooooooo
I went to get something to eat at carls jr and they forgot to give me my fries. This is why these people don’t need $15/hr
Oh, and I said no onion. What do I get? Onions.
@ronnielutes One of my favs!
There’s a lot of people out there “raping gifts” tonight
Wanted to get Legend of Zelda from the eShop but I haven’t used my 3DS in a while. Need to update, which it won’t do until it’s charged.
Pretty dumb that I can’t even access the eShop until my system is updated, which I can’t do because it’s charging with not enough power.
Happy Doctor Who Christmas Special Day everyone! (It actually won’t be happy)
@AndyNico_ it’s gonna be sad tho
Tried updating Pokemon Y since I haven’t played in a month. Can’t connect to eShop. Lovely.
I swear if anyone spoils Doctor Who for me….
Thank god for muting for keywords and people.
Got Doctor Who comics and a shirt, slippers, credit for goldbely, beauty products, A Link Between Worlds, and Altered Beast 3D. Pretty good.
And another Christmas has come and gone
The hard part will be choosing what to spend my $50 for http://d.pr/Xoeb&nbsp;. Everything looks delicious there.
@dannyrodri I KNOW, I WANT EVERYTHING THERE
@dannyrodri Yup, Goldbely is the perfect place to go if you want to fatten up lolol!
Finally saw Time of the Doctor. My feels, man, my feels.
@GordMcLeod He kinda appeared pretty abruptly..
I personally was expecting more from the regeneration scene though.
@Goosedroid Yeah, definitely hit me emotionally regardless.
New Doctor Who comics! http://instagram.com/p/iYSk_lNgpb/&nbsp;
Yay got my olloclip exchanged. Got the telephoto one as a gift from my mom when I wanted the 4-in-1.

@chraarsmi It was about 25 minutes approximately
@imyke I&#39;ve been so behind on podcasts ;-; gah
@imyke May have to declare bankruptcy on my backlog then. But I&#39;ll definitely catch up on The Prompt for sure!
