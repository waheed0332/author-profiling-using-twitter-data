@chadstanton He&#39;s not an idiot, he&#39;s skilled in the soundbyte seeding &amp;knows he&#39;ll be the talk of the town. I quote him &amp; you got cranky.

@jetpacks I know. @kidsleepy already slapped my typo-ing hands.
@chadstanton I&#39;m sure I will. The tone seems to have been the same ever since Absolut teamed up with him and Be Kanye in &#39;08
@chadstanton yes, it might have been, but that&#39;s also part of Jeremy Scott&#39;s &quot;thing&quot;. The pop-irony design and oopsie-controversy.
@chadstanton Well, Ima let you finish, but Kanye is his own meme-legend long before she was ;)
@hiballenergy We drink way more than you supply. pls supply more. :P @kidsleepys
@chadstanton Now THIS gets interesting, are they teaming with Kanye for his skillz or with Kanye for magic attracting press talent?
@chadstanton :D I mean, is his talent to be the one who attracts press by name alone, or do they want him for product development?
@chadstanton .. it gets a bit weird when Kanye (or any other artist) is used like a half-naked lady draped on a car in the 1950s.
@chadstanton Probably.
@chadstanton Yeah, that&#39;s what I always wonder about. If the creative control is limited to &quot;smile for the cameras&quot; it&#39;s a stinky deal.
@chadstanton Hmm. I recall dressing my baby girl in baby phat jeans despite the toddler-unfriendly cut. I am a sucker.

@jfouts I think small businesses will find G+ more useful to them soon.
Adland will go offline for a moment in order to move servers. Enjoy your Saturday!
@jfouts Good idea.
@jfouts I do find G+ userfriendly but archaic in that I have to have a personal acct when really I just want the brand account.
@jfouts As a result nearly 5000 people follow my personal account and everyone ignores the brand account actually used.
@jfouts send us the link when you&#39;re done.
@jfouts Yes, I&#39;ve noticed. I tried to teach a friend running a small business. The constant updates on the g+ app was throwing him off.
@jfouts If there was a away I could move these people to my brand account, I would be happy.

@JRMcGrail To be honest, my eyes rolled so hard they fell out of my head already in the beginning of last week.
@JRMcGrail &quot;controversial&quot; takedowns of ads has always been popular content, ppl share &amp; it&#39;s widely read. It&#39;s what advertiser wants.
@JRMcGrail so, sites that live off advertising, but it&#39;s not their topic, I trust less when they come with an (odd) take on ad. #advertorial
@JRMcGrail Yep. And it stinks to high heaven of paid content. They never pay US to talk about ads. #integrity
