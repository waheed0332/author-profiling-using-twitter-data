@archaeologyman You have the internet so it can&#39;t be all bad ;-) Merry Christmas!
@4fifty1 Nice!  I mean not the hiding from Christmas but Marrakech sounds nice.  Couldn&#39;t hide in London? Or Shropshire?
@4fifty1 @shelter £260 I think.
@vickybarlo Wooo - where did got for Christmas?
@mredwards Merry Christmas!
@vickybarlo Nice!  Visiting family or just going away for Christmas?
@crimeficreader Merry Christmas Rhian! Hope you&#39;ve been well?
@Chiddle84 Yup - and I had to laugh at the heat tweet as my parents have a wood stove which makes you not able to breathe after 1/2 hour.
@crimeficreader New home?  Still Wales?  We&#39;re all well here. Spending Christmas home thankfully.
@Chiddle84 Haha! It&#39;s when they decide that they can&#39;t afford the heating bill but yet will be able to chop wood at 90.
@vickybarlo Well I hope it&#39;s a nice one for you too! x
Looking forward to chatting with my family tomorrow although I hate when we get passed around with &#39;So &amp; so is here, remember them?&#39;
@stevyncolgan Awww sweet - you have the grandkids tonight? How freaking magical is that?
@stevyncolgan Statistically the average time is 5.15 am. Ho ho ho :-)) Merry Christmas Mr Colgan. xx
@LSpurdle Yep. One year I talked to someone who I thought was a nephew for 10 minutes before I realised it was a neighbor!
@LSpurdle This year we have a secret weapon.  FaceTime with bad wifi.  We get annoyed &#39;Opps, so sorry! Wifi is bad&#39;.
Thanks @Just_Will_I_am for starting the #royalpardon for Alan #Turing! @AlanTuringYear

Good morning and a Very Merry Christmas! How is everyone today?
@AboutLondon Merry Christmas!!! We&#39;re up already as C has been asking to open presents since 5. How is A? x
We gave C the cover to her new phone saying it was a promise for a new one in Jan. Her face was a picture when she got the phone. :)))
@AboutLondon Was there enough sparkles on the shoes? ;-) I can not believe you got her Mousetrap. That game is pure evil ;-)
@AboutLondon Damn yes have replied. Should I stick with email/ tweets?
@AboutLondon Tweets it is then! Stuff from us has been opened but nanny is doing 20 gift Treasure hunt later.
@AboutLondon I got an air popcorn maker and season 1 Columbo!
@AboutLondon Mousetrap has been ban from my house. Many memories of hours setting up for it to be over in 2 minutes. I never had patience!
@AboutLondon Normally they did it with advent but C didn&#39;t have time in morning this year. They do riddles &amp; directions (north south etc).
@AboutLondon Sweet! Love the steam train book!
@GiantDespair You too Phil! Merry Christmas! x

@4fifty1 You got a pug? (Autocorrect really wants you to have a pig btw.) @truongthomas
@truongthomas @4fifty1 Like I said, I&#39;m not going anywhere today. It&#39;ll be worth the wait by the sounds of it!
@4fifty1 @truongthomas Ha! I should have known better. Pig might have been right after all ;-) x
For those who weren&#39;t up at 5:30am - MERRY CHRISTMAS! 

For those who were up at 5:30am - you crashing too?
@wood5y And to you! Hope Santa was kind to you?
@mdoness I know I should be happy that she still has the spirit but more grateful she went to daddy at 4am ;-)
@wood5y Dear Lord no. I&#39;m not allowed in the kitchen which is fine by me! I might be asked to help peel carrots... Maybe.
@dusty_jacket What an angel!
@PhilipArdagh @Alex_T_Smith Merry Christmas you two! xx

@GiantDespair We have a few!! We have the hallmark ornament range - brilliant movie.  Gets better with time :-)
@janetedavis We were waiting for most of the family to get over to moms before FaceTime. Up until now, it&#39;ll just be parents arguing ;-)
@custard1980 Amen.  But I&#39;m still going :-)
@custard1980 Was Santa good to you?
@custard1980 CHEESE!  You just reminder me!
Shhh #DrWho is on
Since when is it BBC and not BBC Wales for #DrWho?
FaceTime w family in the states was fun. We couldnt see them but they could see us.  C &amp; I just waved like the Queen until we heard a voice.
Was great to chat with them all though! We need  @scicheer to get on Facetime now! xx

@LSpurdle Same - pjs, food and family (the non fighting family). Been redecorating C&#39;s room which means house is upside down right now.
@telfordlive  I&#39;m not sure - @bethfoster does but she doesn&#39;t live in Shropshire now (but heart will always be here ;-))
@LSpurdle Move one thing, eat. I&#39;m rolling into 2024 ;-) you up for looking at funding soon? Know it&#39;s not festive ...
@AboutLondon Morning! Doing another tube run today?
@AboutLondon Well done! So my dad always does that - saw on FB that apparently he got a snake for christmas. I don&#39;t know either.
@telfordlive will do - I got them to share the experience :)
@AboutLondon I know - I&#39;m not sure of mom knows yet or if it was a joke on FB. Planning on calling him later as haven&#39;t talked to him yet.
@LSpurdle Whenever is good for you - I have time too. Shall we meet for cake?!

@Ioan_Said It started as I want to see their uses in museums- but will be interesting to see what comes from them.
C has a friend coming over at 10 - suppose I should get out of bed.
@gopaldass Fabulous here - been in Pjs since dec 24! Was Santa kind to you?

@4fifty1 Cool.  So are all the pieces thrown in the air at the moment or just the ones you feel like ignoring? ;-)
@stujallen I keep hearing that but so far I&#39;ve had NO luck finding them cheap.  Maybe I&#39;m looking in the wrong places. Amazon?

@travellingcoral I can&#39;t stand crowds, shopping and ques…
@mannyc C is getting new bedroom set but we need to see the stuff as this old house doesn&#39;t have normal walls. Was it crowded?
@diddles54 @scrufflove She better ;-) Currently her room is all over the house (but we managed a lot of bags to charity). x
@travellingcoral C wants a new bedroom set from there.  :-/
@mannyc Seriously, we&#39;re on the top floor of an old house.  Straight walls aren&#39;t an option &amp; we have sloping ceilings.
@mannyc I tried to talk them going tonight as they were open until 10 but we were playing Diary of a Wimpy Kid ;-)
@scrufflove @diddles54 So true!  And I muse remember that I DO NOT NEED CANDLES! xx

@acediscovery Sounds like you had a nice time with family over Christmas - but nothing like going back to your own home ;) Safe travels!
@AboutLondon We should have left an hour ago but Frick &amp; Frack are moving slow. Mug here was the only one up with alarm. AGAIN!
@AboutLondon Breathing and I still have a complicated relationship but getting better. ;-) Any update on virgin coming out?
@AboutLondon Haha - you&#39;ve done really well, much better than I would have been! Here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s a quick fix! x
@travellingcoral I know - and trying to keep control of the budget at the same time- *think happy place* ;-)
@scottkeir Thanks Scott! @zakmensah
@AboutLondon I heard about it but thought it was in Europe (literally only heard name). Now want to learn more (we&#39;re on our way to Ikea!)
@AboutLondon Just back and we did really good!  Everything will get delivered tomorrow. Ikea is about an hour away from us so it takes long.
@AboutLondon Hooray for cable being fixed!!  Bet it feels like you can breathe again :-)

@Longhouses1 Oh no - been out and about and survived Ikea already :-)

@zakmensah @LebelAube I remember Sackler centre in @V_and_A did a program where they lent out cameras to family to snap their fav object.
@Longhouses1 Yes it does.  Been planning it for days now!

@IdrisGeorge Here is hoping they are better than :-) @UPSHelp
@AboutLondon It&#39;s in a freaking warehouse in East Midlands.  Hoping @UPSHelp can help me get more info as should have been here yesterday.
@AboutLondon I&#39;m so freaking annoyed it&#39;s not even funny - but if they have a good excuse then they should say what it is grrr
@AboutLondon It looks like it got through customs warehouse on 26th so hopefully not *fingers crossed*
@Longhouses1 Fees were paid in the states so I better not have fees to pay! @UPSHelp
@Longhouses1 You don&#39;t have that when it&#39;s a gift. :)

@bristolfemuse Sorry Rose - deleted my KIM tweet as it was from wrong account :-) MERRY CHRISTMAS!
@mattcaines @nancyarts Great! We need a good catch up!
@Madlena_P €200 euros is a bit steep for me sadly.  Good luck with your proposal though! If it was free entry for speaker than I&#39;d try :-)
@bristolfemuse Oh no - can it get fixed soon?
@Aratta I had great fun with @mixedreality&#39;s @3doodler last month.  :-)
@Madlena_P Would love to be part of @MuseumsShowoff conference - beed to check with C first as it&#39;s her bday. :-)

@drlucyrogers Here either but it&#39;s promised to be delivered today.  I say we go all American on them if they don&#39;t arrive.
Want to do this… RT @CurateAward: Have you entered @CurateAward yet? Let us know and we&#39;ll retweet you! #curating #arts
@drlucyrogers Being Very LOUD.
@jamiezoob Excellent here - in the middle of redecorating which is a royal pain but will smile when it&#39;s over.  Sickness bug?
@jamiezoob Not when it&#39;s for an 11yo thinking that she&#39;s 17.  Compromises are fun to deal with ;-)
@drlucyrogers @mattdawhit And I&#39;m waiting for Google Glass. The door has been knocked 3 times this morning - NOT for me GRRR
@drlucyrogers Well I just went all American on UPS as they claim not to find the address and will try tomorrow.
Right now - UPS is not my friend.
Evening all! How is everyone tonight?
@LSpurdle So annoyed - promised to be here on Friday, then went back &amp; forth today. Driver claimed it was wrong address. Getting refund.
@implausibleblog After putting C&#39;s room together, I&#39;m very warm ;-)
@Cornettofairy Deep ;-) I&#39;m totally PO&#39;d at UPS. However, got C&#39;s food put together so happy for that!
@miss_scribbler Hooray for brushing off flu! Where&#39;s your new pad?
Only just got C&#39;s room done but she has new wardrobe, king size bed and bureau. When I said done, I mean furniture is put together.
@miss_scribbler I&#39;ll keep fingers crossed for you!
@ypldn Yes!  I owe you money.  Will try to pay tonight or tomorrow (have money but need to find little machine for transfer)
@LSpurdle Me too!  The promised tomorrow between 10-1.  Any plans for NYE?
@miss_scribbler We usually go to the square at midnight which is always fun.  Unless I&#39;m too tired ;-)
@ypldn I know! And well thought out to get the transport tickets :-)
@LSpurdle You up for working on app on Thursday?  I mean I&#39;m free whenever.
@travellingcoral Haha - lets not talk BF but the King size was because the double wasn&#39;t in stock.  Got it for same price!
Looks like Google Glass will be here tomorrow now.  Hope @smorgo and/or @mixedreality are up for the challenge ;-)

For the record, when given the choice of @UPS or @Fedex - go with @UPS. Tuesday waiting for package since Friday with @UPS.

@gopaldass No one ever talks about Kevin anymore ;-) Any good plans for tonight or quiet night at home?
@JaneAudas When it&#39;s brought to you in bed? ;-)
@skyfire747 2014 will be here soon then ;-)
@gopaldass We usually go to the square with everyone but if it&#39;s raining we&#39;re going for quiet night with family. Either way is fun.
@gopaldass Very sharp but you need your social media information on there in contact also.
@Chiddle84 @4fifty1 Happy New Years Eve guys!
@JaneAudas So true - I usually assume anyone but me is better.
Seeing a lot of &#39;End of Year&#39; videos on social media. None seem to be able to handle my year, they get to end of October at best :-/

Trying to create an iTunes account that is based in the states but it keeps asking me for a credit card. Any ideas?pic.twitter.com/r61I4Ysv1t
@Dr_Biscuit I would if I had one…
@M_Fkill Only if they are from the states.  UK debit doesn&#39;t work. Should have No CC option but not appearing. :-/ @Dr_Biscuit
@ThomasMarzano I&#39;m still loving them and learning what they can be used for.
@M_Fkill The killer is I only want to download a free app that is only available in the states. @Dr_Biscuit
@ThomasMarzano Yes - and my response is that these same &#39;tech overruling life&#39; happened with Smartphones. We humans adjust ;-)
@ThomasMarzano Trade offs could be reworded as progression.  Things *will* be different but doesn&#39;t always have to be negative. :-)
@ThomasMarzano Agreed (think we&#39;re agreeing on both points).  This is why they are development stage.
@M_Fkill @Dr_Biscuit Genius!  I wasn&#39;t trying to d/l app first - it works!
@soundcube Just got it to work thanks to @M_Fkill - Thanks!
Whoo hoo! Thanks to @M_Fkill the itune issue is resolved!  :-)
@AboutLondon @ypldn We&#39;re trying not to move much here also although have to go see friend in a bit … think she&#39;ll mind PJs? ;-)
@lifeafterbooze Perhaps. @dinoboy89 @samatlounge
@Acuity_Design Don&#39;t think the argument is with just vision - it&#39;s just that it&#39;s the most onbious with GG. Good luck. @ThomasMarzano
@ypldn Primark ;-) @AboutLondon
@Acuity_Design I don&#39;t think it is undervaluing other senses  - it&#39;s starting with the most pronounced. Business sense. @ThomasMarzano
@lumamendes Unfortunately that didn&#39;t want to work either - finally managed to fake it out with change of timezone, reboot &amp; none cc :-) HNY

#GoogleExplorer I adore the @googleglass community.  Everyone is incredibly patient &amp; answer questions like it&#39;s the first time asked :-)

#GoogleExplorer Tonight I&#39;m going to learn how to get the music to work.  Humming to myself just doesn&#39;t cut it.
@DeaBirkett Thanks for the lovely tweets today! x
@Louiestowell *crosses fingers*  Happy New Years!
@Louiestowell I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fantastic!  Still learning to be #googleexplorer - trying to get music to work tonight.
@alisonbarrow Happy New Year Alison!  Thank you for the offer but you&#39;ve already sent &amp; I&#39;ve already read &amp; loved :-)
#googleexplorer Can&#39;t get the music to play.  Songs listed &amp; music showing but no sound.
@M_Fkill Turned up.  And there is sound through the ear piece but can&#39;t hear music. Not even sure it&#39;s playing TBH

#GoogleExplorer Woot! Factory reset answered a lot of little issues I&#39;ve been having. Music, sending emails &amp; taking pictures so easy now!
@vickybarlo Pretty much the same here - other than mom calling at midnight scarring the hell out of all of us.  2014 will be good though :-)
@sophontrack Is @Rigsbyhatstand with you?  He&#39;s staying at @COMOHotels tonight too!  Lucky Ducks! HNY!

@AboutLondon WHOO HOO!! Had to do a factory reset last night but got things working now.
@4fifty1 I did and I&#39;m freaking loving it!  Happy New Year Chris!
@AboutLondon I&#39;m loving being a #GoogleExplorer the possibilities are endless :-) @COMOHotels @googleglass
@Louiestowell @4fifty1 Been asked how Glass could help/work in museums. Only way to find out is to get a pair and play with them. :)
@4fifty1 Haha no porn and there are filters thankfully! And I&#39;ve been taking notes of my experience but only got them NYE. @Louiestowell

Speaking of @MuseumCamp -both @MuseumCamp &amp; @museomixuk are mentioned in Museum Journal (related to unconferences). :-)
@DianaPitchers Thank you!  I actually forgot that I chatted to them but yay good advert for @MuseumCamp and  @museomixuk :-)

@M_Fkill Sporadic.  I&#39;m fully charing it tonight and leaving it on (I shut it off last night). Then I&#39;m going to charge again and run it tom
.@mia_out I think smartphones already killed that.  I see a lot of potential for Glass.
@mia_out So I presume you don&#39;t like photos in public venues also? Shame that glass owners are prejudged.
@skirrid Kermit is staying for a bit :)
@mia_out Well it seems specific to Glass as you don&#39;t expect venues to request smartphones to be handed in at the door.
@mia_out No - both outcomes are the same.  People thought it odd to hold a phone up to take a picture 5 years ago.
@mia_out Oh I &#39;get&#39; your point, I just don&#39;t agree.  It&#39;s a bit extreme to the reality of Glass use.
@mia_out If ppl want to take a pic, they will regardless of medium.
@mia_out Assuming that everyone with Glass is out to take pictures of you also doesn&#39;t hold much weight. Pics are only part of their use.

@Rigsbyhatstand @ypldn Not at all! I don&#39;t even know where South London is! ;-)
@paulescaped Sure is - on the 11th!  (Sorry, wifi went down then got distracted!)
@SmilyLibrarian That&#39;s the example I provide - no one predicted the way Smartphones /ipads would change things but mocked them :-)
#GoogleExplorer Just posted a picture to Facebook and a different one to Twitter via Glass.  13.07
Only managed 6 *hangs head in shame* RT @Londonist: Tried our mystery museum quiz? The answers are now availablehttp://bit.ly/1dZnZ7I&nbsp;
Woot! RT @Londonist: @MarDixon That&#39;s the best score we&#39;ve heard so far, though, so well done. It was fiendish.
@Patrick_Ness Walking?  You must be in a city ;-)

#GoogleExplorer Took 27 minutes for tweet RT @MarDixon: this is a new book I got #throughglasspic.twitter.com/27JPfwxcxe
Anyone? RT @digitalmaverick: So, no one can help me find out why it is that the World PingPong championships is refreshingly mixed gender?
#GoogleExplorer Plugged charger is due to low battery indicator. 4.5 hours with pretty active use/wifi. Pics, tweet, FB, music used.

#GoogleExplorer that last tweet took less than a minute to appear. Just noticed Glass automatically put #throughglass on tweet.
@M_Fkill Depends on if one of them was available on +1 ;-)
OMG Diagnosis Murder is on after Columbo!!
Shut your face. RT @davidmaybury: @MarDixon 1994 called. It wants it&#39;s television back!
@davidmaybury Roseanne actually :-P
@jamiezoob Amen!  I thought about doing something - even managed to get out of PJs but not now.  :-)
@CaroWallis Well there are TWO eps on Channel 5 :-)

#GoogleExplorer A lot of valid points in that last tweet.  Glass might not be the answer but it’s certainly a game changer.
@RobAroundBooks Apparently, a smart contact lens is already being worked on ;-)
@RobAroundBooks Haha!  But please remember, we control the technology :-) Wearable Tech can have a great benefit for many issues.
+1 RT @jackandraka: . @WendyDrexler @MindShiftKQED @cathycavanaugh part 3 : to create and innovate; to work in diverse cross-cultural teams;
@jackandraka Happy New Year Jack!
Evening all! How is everyone tonight?
@donundeen Someone w Google Glass was not to have them in the Met galleries. What a terrible decision. Can you find out why please?
#GoogleExplorer Seem to be able to send picture to Facebook quicker w/o caption (although still missing from timeline).
#GoogleExplorer #ThroughGlass WHOO HOO! Uploaded a video directly to Youtube.
@GreyTrilby Sounds like a painful experience.
@stevyncolgan It’s not already? ;-) x

YAY! RT @AboutLondon: Received a certificate from @GiveBloodNHS today as I can’t give blood for a while. #veryproudpic.twitter.com/Sq2hqTFOC0
@AboutLondon That was incredibly sweet of @GiveBloodNHS!  I’m sure you’ll be able to donate again soon. x
@theMADmuseum @drlucyrogers *butts in* Love this tweet. Dr Lucy is why I’m following you now!
@Dr_Black Welcome home!
Love this! RT @Distractify: Unknown artist pasted the Photoshop toolbar on several posters of H &amp; M in Germany.pic.twitter.com/J4aY8Lfybi
Night night all! Sleep well with sweet dreams when you get there! xx (Silly Internet not working tonight)
Good morning! How is everyone this lovely Sunday?
#GoogleExplorer It’s funny how much I’ve been using G+ since getting Glass.  NOW I’m starting to ‘get it’.
@DianaPitchers Cold or just depressed about going back to work tomorrow?
Next tweet is a RT from last night but totally worth repeating.
Love this! RT @Distractify Unknown artist pasted the Photoshop toolbar on several posters of H &amp; M in Germany.pic.twitter.com/J4aY8Lfybi
@zakmensah I wear contacts but *always* have sunglasses with me.  As there are no lenses, it’s just a band really.
@playbythebook I tweeted one from @BrooklynKids last night (check my account &amp; @Kidsinmuseums)  @EdintheClouds
@DianaPitchers I’ve yet to venture out yet - dress warm!  I find good gloves help a lot.
#GoogleExplorer 

Can you guys tell me what sort of things you’re interested in knowing about Glass?  Want to share relevant stuff.
@playbythebook I’m sure if kids have used it yet but it is certainly a good way to introduce them to curating a collection.
@Louiestowell I’m working on another post so will try and answer these. How was the states?
@Louiestowell Visit court of law?  Not many ‘visit’ ;-)
@Longhouses1 It’s wearable technology that allows you to ‘do’ things hands free.  The ‘what’ it can do is the big question.
@Louiestowell I’m kidding, I’ve a family with colourful background.  Courts are visited for another reason.

Woot! @flax_maltings is one of them #Shropshire
@RobAroundBooks Not unfriend-ing :-) I think you concentrated on the negatives and failed to mention any of the positives. Like us meeting.
Ha! Also ‘I’m not going to’ RT @CorrinneBurns: Is anyone playing Cameron Bingo? I got &quot;Work Hard and Get On&quot; and &quot;Pensioners Are Exempt&quot;.
@RobAroundBooks That was almost a ‘I have to add this disclaimer’ rather than point out why ppl spend time w tech. ;-)

@AboutLondon Which reminds me - 13/14, Feb 4/5, 19/20 so far ;-) x
@MarDixon Seriously, do you ever sleep? ;-)
Home today? Why not have the kids curate their own collection with Google Cultural Institute http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/home&nbsp;…  HT @EdintheClouds

#GoogleExplorer Charged battery to full last night and left Glass ‘on’ but idle util 12.27 and battery at 11%.
It’s amazing! RT @AnneMHayes: I need to get to @BM_AG to see this exhibition. Looks brilliant! #Photorealism
@Chiddle84 I’m finding the battery fun to work out.  Sometimes it’s zapped quickly, others lasting for 4 hours.
@Chiddle84 True - but you have to remember these are beta. iPhone batteries weren’t brilliant at first either ;-)  LOVE THE HAIR!
So today we’re learning about Henri Matisse as a poster needs to be made.
@stevyncolgan I was kidding!  I don’t do vegetables - bring on the rabbit and bacon! ;-)
@viperdudeuk I’ve addressed battery in this post: http://www.mardixon.com/&nbsp; - it is depending on what you do/how long it last. 4 hr avg.
I just had to give my phone to C to add names to Instagram to me.  #feelsold
#GoogleExplorer What sort of things are you interested in knowing about Glass?  I want to share relevant information.
#GoogleExplorer Finding the notifications brilliant!  The ability to delete/archive emails is time effective.
@viperdudeuk PS I’m answering in a bit more in-depth in the article.
Well this can’t be right…pic.twitter.com/PMxLNtkXfO
@archaeologyman You have the internet so it can&#39;t be all bad ;-) Merry Christmas!
@4fifty1 Nice!  I mean not the hiding from Christmas but Marrakech sounds nice.  Couldn&#39;t hide in London? Or Shropshire?
@4fifty1 @shelter £260 I think.
@vickybarlo Wooo - where did got for Christmas?
@mredwards Merry Christmas!
@vickybarlo Nice!  Visiting family or just going away for Christmas?
@crimeficreader Merry Christmas Rhian! Hope you&#39;ve been well?
@Chiddle84 Yup - and I had to laugh at the heat tweet as my parents have a wood stove which makes you not able to breathe after 1/2 hour.
@crimeficreader New home?  Still Wales?  We&#39;re all well here. Spending Christmas home thankfully.
@Chiddle84 Haha! It&#39;s when they decide that they can&#39;t afford the heating bill but yet will be able to chop wood at 90.
@vickybarlo Well I hope it&#39;s a nice one for you too! x
Looking forward to chatting with my family tomorrow although I hate when we get passed around with &#39;So &amp; so is here, remember them?&#39;
@stevyncolgan Awww sweet - you have the grandkids tonight? How freaking magical is that?
@stevyncolgan Statistically the average time is 5.15 am. Ho ho ho :-)) Merry Christmas Mr Colgan. xx
@LSpurdle Yep. One year I talked to someone who I thought was a nephew for 10 minutes before I realised it was a neighbor!
@LSpurdle This year we have a secret weapon.  FaceTime with bad wifi.  We get annoyed &#39;Opps, so sorry! Wifi is bad&#39;.
Thanks @Just_Will_I_am for starting the #royalpardon for Alan #Turing! @AlanTuringYear
@DianaPitchers Congrats :-)
@SBarryCooper @Just_Will_I_am @AlanTuringYear Absolutely.  And just to be sure - everyone here knows @Dr_Black &amp; @bletchleypark right?
Woot! A delivery from states is in the UK.  I&#39;ll have to wait until Friday but at least it&#39;s getting closer :)
@ge0_ff Hooray!
@drlucyrogers I still have to wait until Friday and then figure out how to use them but still ;-)
Eek - 30 minutes until SANTA!  Night night all! Sleep well with sweet dress when you get there!
@SaminaKosar @LSpurdle Good luck! May we all survive &#39;The Call&#39; :-) Merry Christmas! x
Good morning and a Very Merry Christmas! How is everyone today?
@AboutLondon Merry Christmas!!! We&#39;re up already as C has been asking to open presents since 5. How is A? x
We gave C the cover to her new phone saying it was a promise for a new one in Jan. Her face was a picture when she got the phone. :)))
@AboutLondon Was there enough sparkles on the shoes? ;-) I can not believe you got her Mousetrap. That game is pure evil ;-)
@AboutLondon Damn yes have replied. Should I stick with email/ tweets?
@AboutLondon Tweets it is then! Stuff from us has been opened but nanny is doing 20 gift Treasure hunt later.
@AboutLondon I got an air popcorn maker and season 1 Columbo!
@AboutLondon Mousetrap has been ban from my house. Many memories of hours setting up for it to be over in 2 minutes. I never had patience!
@AboutLondon Normally they did it with advent but C didn&#39;t have time in morning this year. They do riddles &amp; directions (north south etc).
@AboutLondon Sweet! Love the steam train book!
@GiantDespair You too Phil! Merry Christmas! x
@Bashtafarian Wow!
@Bashtafarian Merry Christmas to you and Becky!

@truongthomas @4fifty1 Enjoy the walk - nice weather here but I&#39;m not going anywhere until Friday.
@truongthomas @4fifty1 Now that is freaking adorable! S/he needs antlers.
@4fifty1 You got a pug? (Autocorrect really wants you to have a pig btw.) @truongthomas
@truongthomas @4fifty1 Like I said, I&#39;m not going anywhere today. It&#39;ll be worth the wait by the sounds of it!
@4fifty1 @truongthomas Ha! I should have known better. Pig might have been right after all ;-) x
For those who weren&#39;t up at 5:30am - MERRY CHRISTMAS! 

For those who were up at 5:30am - you crashing too?
@wood5y And to you! Hope Santa was kind to you?
@mdoness I know I should be happy that she still has the spirit but more grateful she went to daddy at 4am ;-)
@wood5y Dear Lord no. I&#39;m not allowed in the kitchen which is fine by me! I might be asked to help peel carrots... Maybe.
@dusty_jacket What an angel!
@PhilipArdagh @Alex_T_Smith Merry Christmas you two! xx

@SumoJim So when you get bronchitis I&#39;ll remind you of it. ;-) I have been blessed with pneumonia this year again - slows me down :)
@SumoJim Went to doctor Monday as thought it was happening again. Stupid lungs. But nothing compared to tough Brody!
@SumoJim It&#39;s been hard, let me tell you ;-)

Evening all! How is everyone this lovely Christmas evening?
@jacquesharris The key is to not stop eating. Want some crisps? ;-) It&#39;s been a lovely Christmas -lovely gifts, delicious food &amp; family time
Just tried to FaceTime mom. She told me to call back in 20 minutes.  I told her she has to wait until Dr Who is over. Daughter of the year.
@jacquesharris Wooo - I ail try that tomorrow as I&#39;m not planning on stopping until jan 3rd ;-)
@GiantDespair We have a few!! We have the hallmark ornament range - brilliant movie.  Gets better with time :-)
@janetedavis We were waiting for most of the family to get over to moms before FaceTime. Up until now, it&#39;ll just be parents arguing ;-)
@custard1980 Amen.  But I&#39;m still going :-)
@custard1980 Was Santa good to you?
@custard1980 CHEESE!  You just reminder me!
