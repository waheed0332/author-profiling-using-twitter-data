@jdromberg The Best Paper Proceedings link from http://program.aom.org&nbsp; has the PDFs of papers, where available, as do the session listings.
@jdromberg But if you mean the actual session, it would up to the organizer if they were broadcasting in some fashion.

Want to follow the who&#39;s who of #AOM2013? Check out this list of Tweet Up tweeps https://twitter.com/AOMConnect/aom2013-tweet-up&nbsp;…
@chandlerism Just missed you! Sorry! I noticed the new name right away!
@JohnAngelis Yes, we started having some server issues. Sorry! Our IT folks are on lock down to get it fixed.
@AOM_HCM The list is a &quot;been there&quot; thing. These are the folks who showed up to the tweet up. There will be another list of connectors.
The #AOM2013 Online Program is having a hard time digesting all the great material and has taken a break. For now, go mobile for schedules.
For those curious, some #AOM2013 Twitter stats. In 2011 &gt; 1,669 tweets; 2012 &gt; 2,247 tweets; 2013 &gt; 2,200 tweets, as of now.
@drubeli From #aom2013 program http://program.aom.org&nbsp;, scroll to Best Paper Proceedings. All papers are there. Slides, it&#39;s up to presenter.
@JohnAngelis @boger Ha! Even if I subtract his 138, still rockin. I started the stats late, too, so we really are even better than that.
#AOM2013 Online Program seems to be working well again, though we are on the lookout for any relapses.
Prepping for member video shoot. First up @davidlamond #IamAOM #AOM2013
