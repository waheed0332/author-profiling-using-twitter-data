Dr. Chris Masterjohn and Joel Salatin are there... http://fb.me/6AJcvjGiU&nbsp;
Are you watching the #vegdebate ?? http://balbit.es/191TzlP&nbsp;
This guy calling a chicken &quot;somebody&quot; needs to read @johndurant &#39;s book- he is humanizing a chicken quite nicely. #vegdebate
Sorry to call him &quot;this guy&quot; but I didn&#39;t catch his name - tuned in later b/c of frozen streams. #vegdebate
Joel has it right about our responsibility as humans to &quot;massage&quot; pasture-based ecology in raising animals/food #vegdebate
@wendytaylor Seriously, it&#39;s such a weak point, they need to stop using it in their arguments. #vegdebate
I don&#39;t know why I find these arguments about growing chickens in order to kill/eat them vs growing tomatoes hilarious, but I do. #vegdebate
AMEN Joel! We don&#39;t need corn and soybeans! #vegdebate #growgrass
@staubio @Pamela_Lund that makes zero sense. increased demand will drive supply up and price down. #economics
@ancestrally @DoctorKateND @IQ2US seriously frustrating
@DCHealthyBites HAHAHAHA
@staubio @Pamela_Lund We aren&#39;t disagreeing on the CAFO issue. None of us sees them as efficient. Growing grass is fairly cheap.
UGH buffering again! #vegdebate
@hossfirooznia @staubio @Pamela_Lund There is plenty of land that could be used but is not.
@staubio @Pamela_Lund I&#39;m sorry you are confused about the cost of raising grass-fed cows.
@staubio @hossfirooznia @Pamela_Lund We do need a different way of helping grass-fed cows become distributed within semi-local areas.
@olaforsstrom Hope so!
Calling Joel Salatin an alternative farmer is quite oxymoronic. #vegdebate
Joel farms as farming should be. Being contrary to the status-quo doesn&#39;t make him alternative. It makes him legit. #vegdebate
@staubio @hossfirooznia @Pamela_Lund Many do. If I had a yard, perhaps I would.
@hossfirooznia @Pamela_Lund @staubio if you say so.
@staubio @hossfirooznia @Pamela_Lund So, something being &quot;a lot of work&quot; means we shouldn&#39;t do it? Raising food used to be our only work.
@staubio @hossfirooznia @Pamela_Lund I don&#39;t think the low cost is a real cost analysis.Cost to whom?And to what?Taxpayers pay,the land pays
EAT ALL THE THINGS WITH FACES #vegdebate #myvote #eatmeat #pastureraised
@melissamcewen I&#39;m one of those zombies :)
@peakscale True, true. ;)
@tomnikkola @ChrisMasterjohn @JoelSalatin grass-fed lamb steak for me.
@AncestralizeMe agreed. Was that moderator biased? or is it me?
@jenn_labrie @AncestralizeMe Maybe all the meat-eaters were out on farms killing their food? ;)
