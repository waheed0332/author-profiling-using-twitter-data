Wait insomnia is so real. You can actually go 2 days without sleeping. You can. And it hurts.
DC you are so hot and annoying today 
Hey Angela welcome to DC, stop getting lost someday.
I just circled union station 4 times I hate Georgetown and I hate summer heat and I hate whoever is outside with petitions and I hate maps.

This whole not sleeping at night sleeping during the day thing is messing me up. I don&#39;t know how vampires do it.
Has anyone tweeted &quot;wake me up when September ends&quot;? Am I first?
This is punishment for spending 22 years judging the hell out of people who don&#39;t sleep. It is a real thing. And I have no NyQuil. #gonnadie
