#Fakebook by @dcicirelli sounds like an interesting read: http://fakebookfriends.com/&nbsp;
Had a dream my entire closet collapsed. THAT was scary. My definition of &quot;nightmare&quot; has been revised.

@StephJWheats Me too! Can&#39;t wait to see how they translate to screen, the book was amazing. Have you read her others?
It takes all my goodwill not to mess with people on Twitter who think I&#39;m someone else...
@KyleRisley Haha I try to be nice...the tweets I write in my head and don&#39;t send are pretty funny though.
@VivaVegasMag You&#39;d be amazed at how many people talk about &quot;their friend @alison&quot; and assume it tags the right person
Excited to read the first chapter of @MelissaGorga&#39;s book: http://us.macmillan.com/BookCustomPage_New.aspx?isbn=9781250041487&nbsp;…
@StephJWheats Yes, they&#39;re so good. (But also a little disturbing.) I think I still have if you want to borrow.

@mattmikulla This was National Geographic. I&#39;ve seen a few others too.
Annoying, but genius: captchas that make you watch an ad and answer a quiz to move forward.
@paulpennelli I can totally see that.
@mac78130 Haha clearly some sort of evil genius.
@StephJWheats Ditto!
@graywolf It&#39;s just plain mean is what it is.
You know it&#39;s going to be a good morning when you wake up to NSYNC reunion news! http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5657788/justin-timberlake-n-sync-to-reunite-at-mtv-vmas-report&nbsp;… (psst, @MrsDebbieW, you see this?)
@MrsDebbieW Yes!!!! I&#39;m gonna start practicing my screaming and marionette dancing now...
And I&#39;ve officially started Christmas shopping. #TisSoNotTheSeasonYet
Pro tip: being rude is never, ever the right strategy. Assertive? Sure. A jerk? No way.
All NSYNC, all day long. Yessssssssss: http://mashable.com/2013/08/20/n-sync-vmas-reunion/&nbsp;…
If you don&#39;t know who NSYNC is, we can&#39;t be friends anymore. But you were probably too young for me anyway:http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/we-now-live-in-a-world-where-people-dont-know-who-nsync-is&nbsp;…

Raisins ruin every baked good except oatmeal raisin cookies. Agree or disagree?
@mattmikulla Agreed, but salads aren&#39;t baked. I&#39;m talking muffins, cookies, etc.
@BenjeezyYaBeezy Oatmeal Chocolate Chip is waaaaaay better. But Oatmeal Raisin is OK, if there&#39;s no chocolate around
@kristy I&#39;m an Oatmeal Chocolate Chip fan, but butterscotch sounds delish too!
@AliCeleste Yeah, the &quot;surprise&quot; factor might be the worst part.
@cookingwhims This was a bran muffin. Not cool.
@mac78130 OK, maybe. Depends on the bread-to-raisin ratio for me.
@McMullen_Greg I usually like &#39;em, as long as they don&#39;t get too raisin-y.
@emichaud Never liked that for some reason, raisins or not. But it&#39;s worth trying again.

After 8 years as a vegetarian, I have FINALLY mastered the art of tofu cooking. Mark your calendars, it&#39;s a big day for soy.
@graywolf  Glass slippers are SO before midnight...

@graywolf I thought 2014 but was overruled.
