#NMX is trending on @twitter #lasvegas
#Productivity panel shout-out @TMNinja @MikeVardy @InkedMN @LeoWid #NMX
Listening to @Scobleizer speaking at #NMX...such a nice personable guy!
I&#39;m sitting behind someone that works for @HuffingtonPost. Gotta love spotting big media sites at conferences #NMX
@mikevardy It was my favorite panel so far....question for you: What is your ratio of writing vs reading for blog?
@ramonray Just saw you on stage at the #nmx keynote with Leo Laporte...had no idea you were here! I write for @MyTurnstone
@ramonray If you have a moment to say hey, that would be great. If not during the conference, perhaps back in NYC?
I think that @NewMediaExpo could be longer...5 days instead of 3 with workshops and special consulting sessions with professionals #NMX
