Hearing about #biodiversity at #sbchi12 There are thousands of edible species, yet most calories come from : corn, rice &amp; wheat
&quot;a diverse system is a robust system.&quot; lack of crop diversity heightens vulnerability to massive crop wipeouts from disease #sbchi12
We&#39;ve lost 90% of crop variety for apples. Enter Dave Snyder&#39;s Chi orchard for rare fruit. Sounds delicious! #sbchi12pic.twitter.com/W9l0Q0MQ
&quot;You can&#39;t plant a seed without the right  fertile conditions. People, partners are part of those conditions&quot; Dave Snyder #sbchi12

Now at #NetImpact12: short video on the DEKA  Slingshot water filter pilot CocaCola sponsored in Ghana, now scaling via kiosks @wdeggers
Fresh tea at scale through innovation, w a machine brewing ~500k bottles/day, keeping @HonestTea fair trade inputs #NetImpact12
@marcgunther you read our minds! Curious what Coke will say about health issues of soda consumption #NI12
&quot;Is the obesity rate a risk to your sales of sugared beverages?&quot; to Coke: &quot;soda is the flatter side; tea is our fast growing segment&quot; #NI12
&quot;stand up if you think the healthcare system is currently attuned to the impact of place on health.&quot; No 1 stood up #NI12
It&#39;s not enough to talk healthy food. Q: How can we build inclusiveness in the food system, food equity? #NI12
A: one solution - let food stamps function at farmer&#39;s mkts #ni12
25% of elementary schools in the US don&#39;t have recess #NI12
David Griswold at #BCorp breakout: a single cert doesn&#39;t hit all aspects of CSR - they use organic, Rainforest Alliance +own metrics #ni12
#BLab cofounder Kassoy: there are 100s of product social resp certifications out there, none that looked at the company integrity. #NI12
Kassoy: We are not an activist playing gotcha, we want to help companies improve if they are floundering, but in cases revoke a cert #NI12

#ni12 Beth of AT&amp;T: You can&#39;t win over all the cynics, even internally. Important to listen, but they can&#39;t steer the ship&quot;
#ni12 Beth if AT&amp;T: Millennials don&#39;t demand more volunteering that boomers, they talk about it and bring those expectations to work
Carol Cone at #NI12: What are the attributes of trust? @edelman i.d&#39;ed 16. Table stakes for companies to connect w consumers
UPS was largest IPO in 20th century + acquired 40 companies. CFO Kurt Kuehn on &quot;organizational judo&quot; of working on sustainability. #NI12
&quot;Internal, quiet revolutionaries&quot; helped current UPS CFO sync consumer choices via tools like carbon calculator for the environment #NI12
UPS helps CARE manage its supply chain for disaster relief, unlike sep indep efforts post-Haiti crisis that got stuck in bottlenecks #NI12
In 20th century, life expectancy went from 45 yrs to 80 years, half attributed to new meds thru pharma - J &amp;J
J&amp;J now in partnership w TB Alliance to deliver the first multi-track TB vaccine in 50 yrs. #NI12
Expensive dev! It takes 5k-10k variations to yield one vaccine, avg of $4b to develop new vaccine. 1 or 2 in 10 breaks even #NI12
Kurt of UPS: Sustainability, to be operationally sustainable, can&#39;t reside w one leader. Lead from behind, listen to employee&#39;s push #NI12
J&amp;J exec: Sustainability can&#39;t be limited to the supply chain/operations ppl in a company, business advocates needed throughout #NI12
Lisa Manley of Edelman on their trust index: trust in government and business  are at an all time low #NI12

Jim Turner of Humana: company was losing consumers so they asked, &quot;what does perfect service look like to consumers?&quot; #NI12
Answer: Factors like accurate, courteous, personalized, proactive care matter #NI12
World Wildlife Fund identified 19 areas critical for wildlife preservation, like Yangtze or Amazon #NI12
Just a few companies control 70% of global trade that passes through critical environs. WWF works w them to I.D opps for shared value #NI12
When brainstorming a good message get to the true benefit. Keep asking, &quot; the benefit of the benefit is the what?&quot; #NI12

@montero Thanks! Too bad we didn&#39;t cross paths at #NI12!
@nikitatmitchell Thanks! Can&#39;t wait to see you again - let&#39;s make it soon!
The Economist: &quot;both men have it in them to be their better selves; but the sad fact is neither candidate campaigned as if that&#39;s the plan&quot;
@drbelotto thanks for a blast from the past! Hope you had fun last night!
@mbgrinberg Great @kaggle piece, thanks for sharing! Didn&#39;t realize some of their #competitions are invite-only
@joncoffey for some gluten free mixes, that&#39;s how it tastes unfortunately :( - but now there&#39;s some better options since so many are gf now!
Nothing like breathtaking time lapses of falling glaciers to highlight #climatechange. A Sundance must-see on my list: http://www.chasingice.com/&nbsp;
@JoshFolk @davidzfang look forward to seeing you at the #DCWeek keynote tonight!
Awesome RT @TechCrunch: Airbnb Partners With http://NYC.gov&nbsp; To Provide Free Housing For Hurricane Sandy Victimshttp://tcrn.ch/Ux4Xu8&nbsp;
@corbett3000 #DCweek keynote  kicks off! http://instagr.am/p/Rv36Mdohtr/&nbsp;
Mayor Vince Gray is talking about everything he&#39;s doing to amp up tech in DC,  eg 5 yr tax abatement for tech startups +enticing VCs #DCWEEK
Vince Gray: jobs in DC tech center grew 4% last year, goal to grow it more. USAToday ranked it 3rd best city for tech startups #DCWEEK
&quot;#Gaming isn&#39;t something that you do, it&#39;s something that you are&quot; #DCWEEK
Travis of @Uber_DC talking awesomeness about crazy logistics of getting a town car in 5 min via real time heatmapspic.twitter.com/YG8AW2GR
Girl Effect creator: &quot;when you are talking about a deep systemic issue (like the girl funding gap), you need to talk to everyone!&quot; #DCWEEK
How to get ppl who don&#39;t think &quot;girls&quot; are their issue interested? &quot;Invest in a girl, everyone wins. Best investment NO 1 is making #DCWEEK
@JasonBilog me too! Headed to the @OPower after party in a few?
@JasonBilog sounds good!
would you &quot;bedshare&quot; at a hotel? Sketchy? @rmchase forbade others at @zipcar from calling it carsharing. Weird &amp; unfamiliar term #DCWEEK
@rmchase: @zipcar:industrial:: @buzzcar: peer-to-peer. Peers are less consistent (need ratings), but innovation of e/user iterating #DCWEEK
Truth. @Noahkunin: we aren&#39;t wed to institutions in how we give, we put our money, as citizens, where the solutions are #DCWEEK
@Noahkunin: the transit subsidy app we helped w/ (via CFPB) is an example of transferable solutions via an API. GitHub enables this #DCWEEK
@noahkunin: we are uniquely positioned to bend the steel pipe of feedback loops to see complaints via CFPB + how theyre shared w us #DCWEEK
At CFPB they have UX gurus in house see where users defect on site, where they fall off, so they can change how they adapt support #DCWEEK
With disasters like #sandy people aren&#39;t waiting for institutions to ask how to help, they just do it. Using their own networks #DCWeek
Steve of @Spacex: we built in failures, made low cost rockets at first so that if it failed hadn&#39;t blown all $100m startup funds #DCWEEK
http://instagr.am/p/RyQMYjIhtq/&nbsp;
Next up: by 2015 Spacex to get humans into orbital space, contracted by NASA, $20m/seat instead of now: we pay $65m/seat to Russia #DCWEEK
Right now Orbital, Boeing, Spacex are IT for orbital space travel in US! #DCWEEK
Steve Davis: We build 92% of our parts in house, it keeps costs down #DCWEEK
Steve Davis: we ( @Spacex) are hiring about an engineer a day currently #DCWeek cc: @wdeggers
Steve Davis: In next 5 yrs, I&#39;m most excited or Falcon Heavy, w 27x the engines as Falcon! Biggest since Saturn 5 @SpaceX #DCWEEK
@Spacex Steve: All the $$ NASA gives us is performance based; if we don&#39;t perform: $0
@chrisheuer hey, are you at the @TechCocktail event for #DCWeek? I&#39;m here w/ Deloitters!

Sasha Issenberg of @Slate at #datasciencedc event: the hardest central targeting decision in a campaign is knowing who NOT to talk to
Issenberg: campaign outreach was used to get out the vote, now it persuades and guages who responds to diff modes of contact #datasciencedc
Ken.Strategic Telemetey:my phone&#39;s computing power is &gt; what I used for micro targeting for Al Gore campaign. World changed. #datasciencedc
Ken: even more important - and harder-  than I.ding who is persuadable in campaign is knowing what to say to them #datasciencedc
@alexlundry data dir. of Romney campaign shares time series #vis of media spots of campaigns #datasciencedc @weggerspic.twitter.com/0JRFTFPL

@jfranks03 Funny RT from @kentonallen. There is some irony about that response to @Instagram, isn&#39;t there?
@DataCommunityDC Really enjoyed last night&#39;s event on #datascience in the campaigns! Great panelists
@poliroots1 Agreed! Really fascinating insights from @kstrasma on why campaign microtargeting has improved so much since 2006 #dsdcmeetup

Why vote on #fiscalcliff today when you can be a hero cutting tax hikes tomorrow? Political antics or pure procrastination? Which is worse?
@AMCaccavale yes, political cover if it weren&#39;t so transparent. After wks of #fiscalcliff press are Americans so easily fooled? I bet not
@AMCaccavale or at least, as Americans, let&#39;s hope not! But enough of political dysfunction. Happy NYE from Capital Hill!!
@chinchilla3000 Ha true.But in reality how we feel 1/1 re #fiscalcliff is prob nbd to them next to impact on all-too-critical voting records

Don&#39;t know what there&#39;s more of at this @DataCommunityDC event: data scientists or people hiring them :) #datasciencedc
John Morton, ICE Director: &quot;part of the solution for #humantrafficking is also a solution for immigration reform&quot; #ihts2013
John Morton: 2 wks ago #humantrafficking coalition was discovered in GA where women were on 4 state circuit, $30/30 customers/day #ihts2013
Last year was a record for # ICE arrests under human trafficking (90 arrests) and federal prostitution charges. #ihts2013
John Morton: &quot;we&#39;ll do a better job as a law enforcement agency if we take a victim centric approach.&quot; #ihts2013
John Morton: T&amp;U visas would encourage illegal immigrants to come forward [I.d #trafficking], to reassure they won&#39;t be deported #ihts2013
John Morton (ICE): I don&#39;t lose a min of sleep putting someone away for 20 yrs/life who trafficks people, destroying their lives&quot; #ihts2013
Case for comprehensive #immigration reform:&quot;too many in this country have uncertain status, and ppl are preying on vulnerability&quot; #ihts2013
Tony West, Assn. US Attorney General: &quot;in last yr DOJ had 200 cases against human traffickers, a 39% inc, sending unequivocal msg #ihts2013
Tony West: Last yr DOJ paid $5.3m to NGOs providing services to those in recovery from #trafficking, to help rebuild lives #ihts2013
Karima Maloney of DOJ: prosecution is how we have declared trafficking intolerable in the US. #ihts2013
Maggie Wynne of HHS on need for collab w NGOs: they help victims stabilize and build trust. Many not trusting of law enforcement #ihts2013
Rogers: we share goal to eliminate #trafficking but may misunderstand roles. Must see how we augment not compete w e/o&#39;s efforts #ihts2013
Karima: we&#39;re seeking to take out entire #trafficking networks; these cases are interconnected and we need to connect the dots. #ihts2013
Most of these #trafficking prosecutions begin with tips from NGOs, goal is to open it up more to tips from citizens. #ihts2013
Primary goal is to find victims, not reverse sting to locate victimizers (Swedish model), deemed not efficient in US model #ihts2013
Rogers, FBI: most who are trafficked don&#39;t initially see themselves as the victim and us as their savior, we have to earn trust&quot; #ihts2013

UN Goodwill Ambassador &amp; Actress Mira Sorvino on #humantrafficking: only 1/100 victims are found and helped #ihts2013
Mira Sorvino: it shouldn&#39;t just be outsiders saying what is best for exploited ppl, victims need a seat at the table. #ihts2013
Why the gap between cases of #trafficking and prosecution, even in US? 1 factor: States w/o regs on #trafficking undercount #ihts2013
Alice Hill,DHS: outreach &amp; education must hit every person that may bear witness to #trafficking, they can tip off enforcement #ihts2013
Genevieve from Coke: Why do I care? 68% of #trafficking victims connect in some way w global supply chains. We&#39;re global, &gt;200 Cs #ihts2013
@Deloitte&#39;s Dan Helfrich asks the #ihts2013 panel: how does mounting data help you pin down #trafficking in your supply chain or otherwise?
Scott Carpenter of @Google Ideas: so much unproductive data now;we need to liberate it without revealing PII. Need data standards #ihts2013
Idea from the audience: to open up data that could help spot #trafficking,clean data like HIPPA did for health data, then open up #ihts2013
@palantir on q &quot;how to open up data to spot traffickers?&quot;: access controls get very granular, so only share PII-free part of data #ihts2013
Ambassador CdeBaca: we need to confront untrue beliefs on #trafficking. Too many believe labor type hits men and sex only women #ihts2013
Ambassador CdeBaca: I don&#39;t know how many #fiscal cliffs you can have before it&#39;s a slope...
Bottom line from Amb CdeBaca: Confront reality, and don&#39;t let  gov off the hook.They aren&#39;t only key player. Smart engagement key #ihts2013
Instead of griping &quot;someone should do something&quot; ask, &quot;what can I do?&quot; #ihts2013
Mira Sorvino gets passionate about #humantrafficking. &quot;They can avoid prison better than drug traffickers!&quot; #ihts2013pic.twitter.com/5N380tJz

#bpsummit &quot;Good social has to be authentic to what author usually writes about and provide value to the reader&quot;
Social content strategy from @robin_riddle at #bpsummit: &quot;Graceful transparency is key, w no element of blur around commercial relationship&quot;
GE&#39;s @tomkellner: a good story has something at stake; a company needs to be honest about challenges, that makes it interesting #bpsummit
Why companies struggle online, @robin_riddle: compliance depts are overwhelmed by volume/speed of social media, so they ignore it #bpsummit
Q @ #bpsummit: what happens if negative news breaks about companies sponsored on news site? Insurance policy for brands to avoid neg press?

&quot;So many companies tell stories in places where everyone runs away from them - we mute, FF, seek distraction to avoid watching&quot; #bpsummit
&quot;For 1st time ever, quality of content IS the distribution&quot; $$ moves to what attracts an audience instead of paying for spots&quot; #bpsummit
