Inspirational speech by our great MP @CarolineLucas on the societal value of arts, quoting everyone from Jeanette Winterson to Steve Jobs.
&quot;A civilised society should not be neglecting its most vulnerable people but nor should it neglect its cultural heritage.&quot; @CarolineLucas
&quot;The language of the market has seeped into everything. I want to be a citizen, not a customer.&quot; @CarolineLucas
This Friday eve come to the Cube Cola Trading Post at ONCA. We&#39;ll be mixing up drinks &amp; hacking carbonation: http://is.gd/cubecola&nbsp; #BDF2013

&quot;one might wonder whether we can ever directly validate any quantum effects associated with the gravitational field.&quot; http://is.gd/gravitons&nbsp;
&quot;cosmology provides a realistic observable that is directly tied to the quantization of gravity.&quot;: http://is.gd/gravitons&nbsp;
Observing &quot;a cosmological gravitational wave background associated with an inflationary phase would provide evidence&quot; http://is.gd/gravitons&nbsp;
&quot;It does so in a way which is heuristically equivalent to all laboratory experiments that probe quantum phenomena.&quot;: http://is.gd/gravitons&nbsp;

I would very much like to tell you about the story that @julian0liver just sent me.  But I genuinely don&#39;t know how I&#39;d begin to try ...
&quot;Despite his tragic sartorial collaborations with the avian world John still believed that somehow he could to make his transistors smaller&quot;
&quot;John’s coworkers eventually understood his wisdom, and their need to wear coffee-resistant indoor ponchos lessened with time.&quot;
&quot;John’s massive parallelism strategy assumed that lay people use their computers to simulate hurricanes, decode monkey genomes and ...&quot;(1/2)
&quot;... multiply vast dimensioned matrices in an attempt to unlock eigenvectors whose desolate grandeur could only be imagined by Poe&quot; (2/2)
&quot;even though you’ve been sued by several pedestrians who suddenly acquired rare paintings as hats, you go out the master of your domain.&quot;
&quot;As the transistors became increasingly unpredictable, the foundations of John’s world began to crumble.&quot;
&quot;So, John did what any reasonable person would do: he cloaked himself in a wall of denial and acted like nothing had happened.&quot;
&quot;The point is that flying in airplanes used to be fun, but now it resembles a dystopian bin-packing problem&quot;
Can the internet give James Mickens a round of applause, please, for this superb hypnogogically indescribable text: http://is.gd/slowwinter&nbsp;
&quot;Thus, when John said &#39;imagine a world in which you’re constantly executing millions of parallel tasks,&#39; ...&quot; (1/2): http://is.gd/slowwinter&nbsp;
&quot;… it was equivalent to saying &#39;imagine a world that you do not and will never live in&#39;.” (2/2):  http://is.gd/slowwinter&nbsp;
&quot;John learned about the new hyperthreaded processor that ran so hot that it burned a hole to the center of the earth&quot; http://is.gd/slowwinter&nbsp;

I&#39;d go so far as to say that if the only thing that came out of #xoxofest was this http://is.gd/frankch&nbsp; it would be worth it just for that
@fchimero @xoxo this is one of the most poignant &amp; important pieces I&#39;ve read in a while. I&#39;m going to reread &amp; share widely. Thank you.

&quot;I&#39;ve been haunted by this question: what is the narrative form for the internet&quot; @cfonnes #reFramedfilm
Honestly, Cloud Chamber Mystery by @cfonnes looks awesome. Site goes live on 4 October. Trailer here: http://vimeo.com/72414275&nbsp; #reFramedfilm
&quot;I wanted to figure out the Universe. So, Cloud Chamber is about that.&quot; @cfonnes on making astrophysics-based online drama #reFramedfilm
&quot;It&#39;s like a 3D Wikileaks&quot; @cfonnes on the Cloud Chamber Mystery. Yes, it is that good. #reFramedfilm
So @cfonnes &amp; his team have literally build the geology of T&#39;Rain in the Cloud Chamber Mystery. Landscapes based on real data. #reFramedfilm
&quot;We&#39;re applying the principles of Dogme 95 to transmedia storytelling&quot; @cfonnes #reFramedfilm
&quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology would be indistinguishable from *Nature*.&quot; @cfonnes reframing the Arthur C. Clarke quote #reFramedfilm
&quot;We&#39;re telling a story that combines astrophysics and teenage rebellion.&quot; @cfonnes  #reFramedfilm

Jawdropping - NASA have actually banned Chinese researchers (including those based in the States!) from a conference:http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/05/us-scientists-boycott-nasa-china-ban&nbsp;…
&quot;Nasa officials rejected applications from Chinese nationals citing a law which prohibits anyone from China setting foot in a Nasa building&quot;
&quot;Science is supposed to be open to all and restricting those who can attend by nationality goes against years of practice&quot; @chrislintott
@paulmison I respectfully disagree. It could have been shifted to a different venue. Indefensible to ban scientists for political reasons.
@paulmison I can&#39;t believe that venue expenses would trump the principles of open science, which remained in place even during the Cold War.

@mildlydiverting @matlock Its shot by the people who filmed The Killing. So part Nordic Noir, part Wonders of the Universe. &#39;Science Noir&#39;.
@cityofsound but Joi Ito&#39;s point is that this is not the case. He&#39;s arguing for a skillset that includes all four. &amp; I&#39;d agree with that.
@cityofsound surely we&#39;ve moved beyond making the traditional art-science v design-engineering distinctions. Reality is more intertwingled.

&quot;We have entire systems built around not reality, but *perceptions* of reality.&quot; - Alberto Nardelli at #7xLDN

Mark Leckey &amp; @iamdanw take the stage at #7xLDNpic.twitter.com/8g965Uj97a
Mark Leckey makes the important point that its difficult to create anything meaningful in one day. Collaboration takes time. #7xLDN
&quot;Flip flopping is a term by Robin Sloan that describes making something digital physical and then making it digital again&quot; @iamdanw #7xLDN
&quot;One of my interests is making the infrastructures of technology legible&quot; - @iamdanw channeling Bridle &amp; Arnall at #7xLDN
It&#39;s fast becoming apparent that the real value of 7on7 has been the conversations between the participants. Which is no bad thing. #7xLDN
Mark Leckey made a work about the inner thoughts of an Internet fridge. Deeply wonderful. #7xLDNpic.twitter.com/LcjCdzioPH

Fascinating analysis of the animistic qualities of the Internet of Things by @iamdanw &amp; Leckey. With the obligatory reference to OOO #7xLDN

The Internet of Dreams - where the real and the fictional happily coexist. As described by @iamdanw. #7xLDN
Important point there by Mark Leckey &quot;Dan was too sympathetic&quot;. That&#39;s because @iamdanw has a creative practice of his own. #7xLDN
&quot;Once you put something in a gallery, you cut of its media-cyborg dimension&quot; - massively important point there by @iamdanw #7xLDN

An definite must-watch stream MT @luxdarkmatter LUX announcing first results tomorrow. Live webcast here: http://sanfordlab.org&nbsp; #darkmatter
I&#39;ll be getting read to talk about the #smartcity as the @luxdarkmatter results come in at 3pm, so can someone let me know what they found?
&quot;I&#39;m interested in a form of smartness which emerges from people rather technology&quot; - Usman Haque (@uah) #smartcampic.twitter.com/lWoyMlTAUD
&quot;Technology companies are selling us a view of the future where connected technology delivers a kind of homogeneous boredom&quot; @uah #smartcam
&quot;Arts, culture and well being are difficult to measure on a computer&quot; @ClaireMookerjee from the Future City Catapult #smartcam
This. Is. Brilliant.  @jomc and @nimbu can help the Men of the Internet Learn to Search: http://learn-to-search.com/&nbsp; (via @debcha)
&quot;What is a city? A city is not its buildings or infrastructure. It&#39;s the interactions between people and ideas.&quot; @uah #smartcam
&quot;Security, predictability &amp; convenience are things that make cities bearable. Not smart.&quot; @uah #smartcam
&quot;The people who benefit from efficiency, predictability &amp; convenience are the city managers. Not the citizens&quot; - @uah  #smartcam
&quot;When you start seeing the city as a problem to be solved, you lose the capacity to value mess &amp; complexity.&quot; - @uah #smartcam
&quot;A better vision of a smart city is one full of smart citizens, not just smart technological infrastructure.&quot; - @uah  #smartcam
A brilliant vision of what a properly smart city could be by @andrewnairne, highlighting the current absence of smartness #smartcam
&quot;Can a city be smart if so many people can not afford to live here?&quot; @Puffles2010  raises an important sociological question at #smartcam
&quot;A smart city is one that gauges the welfare of all its citizens.&quot; @jonpratty underscoring that smartness if not just about tech #smartcam
Seamfulness enters the debate in a discussion about the dystopic dark side of the traditional technological smart city. #smartcam
Seems like there&#39;s a massive gap in the market for some kind of art-science-technology agency in Cambridge. #smartcam

@AdamRutherford Ahh, gotcha! So they&#39;re even-numbered years?
Timely question given the Kepler conference. @shaka_lulu, want to take a stab? MT @AdamRutherford: Number of exoplanets as of this moment?
@shaka_lulu Thanks Lucianne. I knew you&#39;d be able to help. Suspect @AdamRutherford would prefer confirmed. Would that be right, Adam?
@AdamRutherford Not the optimal moment to ask them to stop, since all the exoplanet hunters are at #Kepler2. Counting. cc @shaka_lulu
@AdamRutherford It is *the* exoplanet conference: http://nexsci.caltech.edu/conferences/KeplerII/&nbsp;… - You know. The one that generated a fair bit of, err, controversy.

@gsvoss Sigh. Don&#39;t get me started. Ranting on the back-channel. Mining. Letting refugees drown at sea. Genocide. Concentration camps.
