A good manager innovates all things correctly, a good leader only innovates a few, the correct and trenscendent ones #innovation
Its said leaders know and show the way to others, I believe a good leader always doubts of all paths and teaches us to question them,
Steve Jobs &quot;Innovation distinguises a leader and a follower&quot;.  I believe leaders&#39; innovations are more disruptive and improve the world
Leaders make people dream, learn, grow, improve and be happy. El líder hace que la gente sueñe, aprenda, crezca, mejore y sea feliz
Leaders are a step ahead in their vision, at the same height, closer in the day to day, and a step behind, leaving space, when delegating

Alan Turing &quot;We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done&quot; Lets do things, make #ideas happen
Alan Turing &quot;Mathematical reasoning...is the combination of two facilities, which we may call intuition and ingenuity&quot;#ideation uses both
Alan Turing &quot;A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human&quot; Its hapenning

&quot;It is better to have useless knowledge than to know nothing&quot; Seneca. I think useless knowledge to most is knowledge to some
&quot;All art is an imitation of nature&quot; Seneca. I believe Nature is all, is everywhere is part of all we see feel and create
BigData useless knowledge until analysis/hypothesis validation and conclusions to act innovatively occur. BD intrinsically useful knowledge
&quot;Be silent as to services you have rendered, but speak of favours you have received&quot; Seneca

Discovering Science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson &quot;One should not be too distracted by definitions. Ideas often transcend definitions.”
Neil deGrasse Tyson When I tweet I carve the words and whats left is the most important concept to communicate in a simple &amp; most direct way
Neil deGrasse Tyson &quot;When I tweet I feel like Michael Angelo I cut away everything that is not... a tweet  is like a soundbite&quot;
@neiltyson &quot;We&#39;re entering a new era where science and space in particular are artists muses, taking a new relationship with your culture&quot;

Quote O´Leary @EFNI &quot;Brussels is the Empire Base, Berlaymont bdg the Death Star where every shred of innovation is left outside the door&quot;
@EFNI Innovation Euro strategy failed, it was treated as an official religion leading to disbursement of tax revenues on admin objectives
@EFNI Euro Innovation Strategy failed, Many countries policies of R&amp;D based mainly on grants thus making #innovation dependent on EU funds
@EFNI National policies treated ideas and projects in a protectionist manner preventing the emergence of a European common #innovation space

If an elderly scientist states something is possible, he is almost certainly right. if impossible, he is very probably wrong. Clarke&#39;s Law
Artgur Clark&#39;s 2nd Law &quot;The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible&quot;
Arthur Clarke&#39;s 3rd Law&quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&quot; that is why it suffers resistance #innovation

Alan Turing &quot;We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done&quot; Lets do things, make #ideas happen
Alan Turing &quot;Mathematical reasoning...is the combination of two facilities, which we may call intuition and ingenuity&quot;#ideation uses both
Alan Turing &quot;A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human&quot; Its hapenning
Alan Turing &quot;Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition&quot; Para pensar
Alan Turing &quot;Machines take me by surprise with great frequency&quot; I could not agree more specially today #ideas, design, technology combined
Alan Turing One of the greatest innovators, the imagination to decipher codes and other mathematical challenges #innovation #ideas
