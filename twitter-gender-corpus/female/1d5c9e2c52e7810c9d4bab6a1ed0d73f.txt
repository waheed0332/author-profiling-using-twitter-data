I received a miracle of forgiveness today. A weight I had carried in my heart for 18 years has been lifted.
@pacaunt It was very unexpected,  believe me!
Happy Birthday @_sethyoung! http://instagram.com/p/hmblPqAkHJ/&nbsp;
The little one had one of the worst, most emotional days I&#39;ve experienced with her. Wow. Never felt so heartborken &amp; helpless.
She is so, so sensitive. Can&#39;t handle any meanness from other kids or disapproval from her teachers. She is just devastated.
Trying to work with her to help rebalance energetically, but sometimes I think I am too close to it.
@stacyreno She was just a mess today. Beyond anything I have ever seen. It&#39;s like having my heart cut open.
@stacyreno I was thinking of you and G. So much easier for me to work with other kids and not my own!
@stacyreno Oh no! Our little girls. :-(
@dagmarebaugh Thanks mama!
@nerdkween That&#39;s a great aura color to have!
@DesirreAndrews Wish my uterus was that happy! LOL

The little one has her 3rd &amp; final hot cocoa fundraiser benefiting @DecPresbyterian&#39;s Threshold Ministry today!
She has raised over $200 so far to purchase hats, gloves &amp; scarves for the homeless &amp; poor!
We are going to make a trip to the store this week to purchase them &amp; present the items at our volunteer holiday party.
@woowoo76 That&#39;s awesome!

@francesk @DecaturSquared Oooh yes! I loved those old tokens!
Church play rehearsal is cutting into my dinner time. My kid did look cute in her angel costume &amp; grumpy face, though.
The Christmas pageant that never, ever ends and the parents die of hunger in the pews. The end.
Meanwhile, the children dressed as wise men and shepherds are wrestling in the narthex. #truestory
One child dressed as a wise man says to the other, &quot;Tell him to shut up&quot; about the third, as the angel of the Lord looks on.
The random moments happpening around the Christmas pageant rehearsal are funnier than the play itself.
@CthatPath I&#39;m gnawing on a Sharpie as we speak.
My grumpy angel just ran off the stage to beg me for something to eat.&quot;Do you not understand how hungry I am?&quot; she says.
Dinner. Finally!
@stacyreno she got a box of raisins.

I may end up without health insurance if I can&#39;t get this &quot;health assessment&quot; scheduled THIS week.
You&#39;d think getting health insurance from a hospital employer would be better/easier/quicker, but it isn&#39;t.
All this talk of Advent, reflection &amp; turning toward God. And what do church people do? Schedule more events &amp; luncheons.
@ProseMakerMedia I can&#39;t opt out of some of it, but trying to do what I can to limit events.
Hoping the little one&#39;s choir rehearsal goes better than last night. [Hiding in church library, trying to get blog posts done.]
@stacyreno I could barely make myself leave the house to do ANYTHING, much less run. Today is a #rainday, not #runday.

Seriously,  I wrote over 3 pages of notes so far on Scripture passages. Guess that&#39;s a clue that seminary is in my near future.
It&#39;s just good manners to shake hands with others at social &amp; political functions. Your parents did teach you that, right?
This week, a person w/whom I had a falling out nearly 20 yrs ago (my fault) shook my hand. That was personal &amp; meant a lot.
Me too RT @francesk: @danayoung Leap of Faith parables are what get me through the days most of the time...
Huh? RT @ATLGreg1: Rand Paul says extending UI benefits would be a “disservice” to those Americans (including many veterans) receiving them.
The politicians trying to cut unemployment benefits have never experienced the shame of having to go &amp; apply for them.
@ATLGreg1 That&#39;s bull &amp; we all know it. Jobs are not that easy to come by, even for skilled workers.
@ATLGreg1 I&#39;ve been on unemployment twice. The whole process is very demoralizing &amp; a lot of time is spent waiting.
@rjmedwed @ATLGreg1 Oh, right. Duh. Why didn&#39;t I think of that? Because I&#39;m lazy. That must be it. ;-)
@JeffHaws @ATLGreg1 $11K &amp; SNAP: livin&#39; the good life. Tell that to the people I see when I volunteer at our church&#39;s homeless ministry.
@ATLGreg1 @JeffHaws Maybe a broken-down used old Caddy.
@ATLGreg1 It almost makes receiving the benefits not worth the hassle.
@LaurelSnyder @JeffHaws @ATLGreg1 Nope, it sure doesn&#39;t. We didn&#39;t have health care for a year when hubby was unemployed.
@ATLGreg1 @JeffHaws Awww man. If only I could have had a few more kids...
@ATLGreg1 I never want to go on UI again.
@LaurelSnyder @JeffHaws @ATLGreg1 Not sure it was an option for us either. It was a tough year.
@ATLGreg1 And sitting through classes I didn&#39;t need. No attempt to help people at the level they required.
@ATLGreg1 I could have taught the resume writing class.
@rjmedwed @CBL1978 @OBoudreaux @ATLGreg1 What about that Jesus guy?
@LaurelSnyder @JeffHaws @ATLGreg1 My goodness, I had no idea. That is definitely not an option for you.
@LaurelSnyder I hope things improve soon for you. Wish there was something I could do.
@LaurelSnyder I understand. I used to have more complex health issues &amp; seeing your own docs is necessary when needed.
@ATLGreg1 Why does that not surprise me?
@ATLGreg1 @CBL1978 @rjmedwed @OBoudreaux I think you must be talking about the money changers at the temple. Oops. Wrong poor people.
@abba_ks I have to go for a health assessment on Thurs &amp; have to fast for 8 hrs before. And drive out to who knows where OTP. #grumpy
Oh, right RT @ATLGreg1: @danayoung @CBL1978 @rjmedwed @OBoudreaux “Blessed are the businessmen, for they will inherit huge holiday bonuses.&quot;
@abba_ks It was either that or not have health insurance. And I&#39;m a year behind on my mammogram (you can yell at me later.)
The rain is moving out after 6 days so that frigid temps can move in. Why do I not live in the tropics?
@abba_ks They changed the requirements &amp; spouses have to do this yearly health assessment thing. I rarely go to docs....

@francesk A memorial service should be a celebration of life, right? The pic isn&#39;t a big deal; wasn&#39;t disrespectful.
@francesk I&#39;ve been to funerals where friends posed next to open casket of the deceased - this was years ago, before selfies.
A fake sign language interpreter is more offensive at a televised memorial than group pics anyone snapped during the service.
@francesk During my grandmother&#39;s viewing, we took group family photos, because it was the only time we were all in the same room.
@francesk Mandela lived a very long, inspired life. It *should* be the cause for much celebration &amp; joy (mixed with sadness, of course.)
Stomach not feeling well this morning. Wish I could crawl back to bed.
@francesk Absolutely. Funerals &amp; memorial services don&#39;t need to be grim, somber affairs. Especially not for a life well-lived.
My mom is partially deaf &amp; struggles to hear in crowded places. A fake interpreter at events does everyone a deep disservice.
@stacyreno Thanks - just one of those days (and my many digestive woes.)
I remember my mom working to regain her balance &amp; learning to lip-read after losing her hearing during surgery. It was a hard recovery.
People with hearing impairments live with an invisible disability &amp; are misunderstood by others who don&#39;t realize they can&#39;t hear.
Many people thought my mom was ignoring them or being a snob, but she couldn&#39;t hear them or see that they were addressing her.
Even I forget sometimes to make sure I&#39;m facing her directly when speaking to her &amp; she&#39;s been hearing impaired since I was 9.
Living with an invisible disability can be a very alienating. If people can&#39;t see why you&#39;re struggling, they don&#39;t believe it.
There are many types of invisible disabilities - anxiety, depression, addiction, chronic pain - can all fall in this category.
The little one is going to be in her 1st Xmas play tonight, singing in the &quot;Angel Choir.&quot; Note to self: don&#39;t wear mascara.

@mustangmelatl It&#39;s elementary school, so I bet it&#39;s because the PARENTS don&#39;t want to walk in the cold. Too young to let kids walk alone.
@mustangmelatl Although when I was growing up in NYC, we had no choice but to walk in whatever weather was out there.
@mustangmelatl Thanks! We need to get over there again for dinner now that y&#39;all are officially open!

@francesk Well, the DOLL clothes I still have - not the clothes she made for me. Wish I did, though!
@francesk My grandmother made my sweaters for me. I miss her - and those sweaters!
@mustangmelatl Yup - my mom did that too! She collects special edition Barbies.
@stacyreno I try to remind myself of the things I wanted at that age. And we live in an area of such affluence too.
Me too. RT @d3bbie: I need a clone.  Or an indentured servant.  Just until Christmas is over.
One of my favorite parts of Scripture is the Annunciation &amp; how the event has been depicted in sacred art over the centuries.

Comments about the &quot;quality of people&quot; on MARTA are precisely why our public transit fails to be used like it should.
In other cities like NYC, DC or Chicago, using public transit is not a stigma. Which is why ATL is never going to be world-class.
@stacyreno For real?! When did that happen?
@stacyreno I remember seeing a Dekalb police car down toward Ponce on our street last night. Bet that&#39;s where it happened.

@ndcollier Has Reiki helped some with the discomfort?
@ndcollier I assume you&#39;re trying to avoid the surgical route? I&#39;ve worked with so many women who deal w/fibroids.
Did anyone really expect enlightened social commentary coming from the Duck Dynasty guys?
@rjmedwed Don&#39;t you know? Freedom isn&#39;t free, but free speech is!
@ndcollier That could be very helpful! Keeping my fingers crossed for you!
As usual, @JesusOfNaz316 says it way better than I ever could.

And I realize why our neighborhood had NO say. On the border of ATL/Druid Hills &amp; not as connected with rest of Oakhurst community.
Also, at least one person I know who has a kid at Oakhurst hasher grandfathered in b/c she&#39;s going into 3rd. So he&#39;s not in the fight.
@CubaLibreSez No bad schools but  Westchester is further away &amp; yet another adjustment for her socially, etc.
@dagmarebaugh Well, you know how that goes. There wasn&#39;t enough of a fight.
@CubaLibreSez She is going to have to take the bus b/c there is no way I can drive her to W&#39;chester in AM &amp; stepson to DHS. Too crazy.
@CubaLibreSez Thank you. We do the best we can, I guess. :-) I just wish we could keep kids in ONE school for more than a couple of years.
Anyone know of a shoe repair place in/near Decatur that does a good job of cleaning suede boots?
@stacyreno I guess I shouldn&#39;t ask you how you came by this knowledge.

Yes, there&#39;s that too. @rjmedwed: @danayoung I think we need more people to learn how the Constitution works in general.
@rjmedwed There is a good comment in that article you posted where someone explains it. Sad that it&#39;s buried in the comments.
@rjmedwed The biggest issue I see is that the Robertsons keep saying we&#39;re infringing on their freedom of religion (not 1st Amendment btw.)
@rjmedwed They&#39;re hiding behind the &quot;sin clause&quot; to make their statements &amp; defend them on religious grounds.
@rjmedwed I completely agree with you, but they don&#39;t get it &amp; neither do &quot;Sound Bite Americans.&quot;

@francesk Oh no, really? Sending a prayer up to Archangel Chamuel to help locate your package soon!
@stacyreno Don&#39;t stop believin&#39;!
@francesk It was on the Santa list. I don&#39;t know if she had seen one previously, but I found one made by Melissa &amp; Doug that was cute.
@rjmedwed I grew up in half Catholic/half Jewish house. We celebrated both but I don&#39;t see why Jews might think they&#39;re missing something.
@francesk She is ALL about her stuffed animals. Meh on dolls &amp; other girly toys. Her room is like a plush farm. LOL
@rjmedwed That&#39;s what we did. Although there were a few Jewish-themed ornaments on the tree for my dad. But he liked that.
@rjmedwed Hanukkah was celebrated as a distinctly different holiday than Xmas. Same with Easter &amp; Passover. We respected traditions.
@rjmedwed No, not even if they call it a Hanukkah bush. They&#39;re not even about the same events.
@rjmedwed I understand. These articles tend to be way too flip about things that are very meaningful to people. We need sacred events.
@rjmedwed Jesus even would have told you that. ;-)
Precisely. RT @rjmedwed: @danayoung (Jesus would have celebrated Hanukkah.)
@rjmedwed I found that celebrating Jewish holidays gave me context for Jesus&#39;s life &amp; ministry. So grateful for that exposure.
@rjmedwed It depends on the denomination. In my case, it was just my life growing up. Also lived next to an Orthodox community.
@rjmedwed Is that an alternate name? Never heard of it.
@rjmedwed That would explain it.

@livyloorose Merry Christmas to you!
For once, nearly ALL of my gifts are wrapped! My back is spasming, however. Wine, please!
@abba_ks There is no good way to wrap gifts without jacking up your spine. After a while, I just throw everything into gift bags.
Merry Christmas Eve to all!

@stacyreno Same to you, dear friend! xo
Yes, really. RT @stacyreno: Dear Santa, why didn&#39;t you leave a full pot of coffee for me?
Merry Christmas! May peace, hope, love and joy be yours today and always.
Please let us Christians celebrate Christmas without comment. I respect your holidays &amp; traditions too. Thank you.
I&#39;m sorry there are Christians who aren&#39;t respectful of other people&#39;s traditions. But there are plenty of us that are.
There is so much good to be celebrating this season, regardless of *what* you believe. Allow joy &amp; peace into your heart.
Not trying to be grumpy. Just my daily reminder to ask us all to try to be nicer to one another.
@semiotic_pirate @stacyreno I actually went back to sleep for an hour after the kid startled me out of bed to open gifts.
Now that Christmas dinner is done, I am done.
@BlissInMe A cloud of delectable delights, no doubt! Merry Christmas to you and Bliss!
I really could go the rest of my life without having to endure another holiday dinner discussion about football.
I have nothing ever to contribute to a discussion about football - pro or college. Let&#39;s talk about books or art instead!
@JaMonkey I SO wanted crumb coffee cake this morning!
The little one is scootering around the house singing a song about her brother not having the Christmas spirit.
Yesterday she scootered around singing about Jesus. Today it&#39;s Christmas spirit. I think we might have an album in the works.

I don&#39;t think there is enough vitamin D to compensate for this weather.

Seriously?! What the hell happened to good manners &amp; filters on your thoughts? Think before you post your comments, people!
@GrabMoL Yeah. Totally floored me. And this woman is so sweet - would never say an unkind thing to ANYONE. Made me feel so bad.
@pnuts_mama I am STILL picking my jaw up off the floor. I feel so bad for my friend. She is the sweetest person.
@GrabMoL I&#39;m tempted to report her! ;-)
@mamaerika It&#39;s such a tough balance. Strict enough so they know you mean what you say but not so much they rebel against you. Hugs mama!
Uh what? RT @DecaturGAPatch: A reader writes Decatur should cease to exist as a city in his Op-Ed. What do you think? http://bit.ly/1fStINX&nbsp;
@mamaerika Oh man. I always hated it when my mom talked to me when I was in trouble. That could be worse than any punishment. LOL
@stacyreno Wait. He said WHAT?!
@semiotic_pirate And frankly, I think some people just make thoughtless comments without considering WHAT they are really saying.
@stacyreno You may want to tell him if he doesn&#39;t cut the bulldh*t that you&#39;ll ask for court-ordered mediation/family therapy.
@stacyreno That was bullsh*t by the way. So pissed I can&#39;t even spell straight!
@stacyreno He is holding your girls emotionally hostage, which is wrong, wrong, WRONG.
@semiotic_pirate Same here. But then again, I think we care about what we want to say.
@stacyreno Perhaps explain to him that lying &amp; manipulating his child will only mean she&#39;ll resent him later on in life?
@stacyreno Sending you and your sweet girls a BIG hug!

The 6 year old is crying because she did her hair &amp; didn&#39;t like how it came out. I&#39;m afraid of the teen years already.
@GrabMoL I told her that I have plenty of bad hair days too. And that she is still beautiful,  even if she didn&#39;t her hair.
@francesk My daughter has much easier hair than mine (only wavy &amp; not coarse) and yet she still wants it to be stick-straight.
@francesk She uses mousse already! And we condition with shea butter. She has the benefit of my years of suffering with frizz. :-)
@francesk My mom has stick-straight hair. No help to me whatsoever.  :&#39;(

@pnuts_mama Yes it is! Hope it lifts for you soon. I&#39;ve been piling on the vitamin D to help counteract mine.
Two of my friends are in India, and posting their pics. Makes me miss that beautiful country so much.
@pnuts_mama It does seem to help. You might need to up your dose a bit, esp if you have been nursing.
@pnuts_mama I take 1000 mg. Seems to be helping me but if we have more rain/gloom like we&#39;ve been having, I&#39;m upping that mofo.
@pnuts_mama @readergirl I&#39;ve heard it does help. My husband is now convinced I need to live somewhere further south than here.

@semiotic_pirate Drives me nuts when manufacturers made a great product &amp; then stopped producing it or made changes.
@semiotic_pirate Yes, completely agree! Or they change the sizing model they use for the product so nothing fits the same way.
@semiotic_pirate I&#39;ve had that happen so many times with jeans manufacturers - even ones who claim to have &quot;classic&quot; styles/sizing.
@semiotic_pirate I have trouble finding pants that fit b/c I&#39;m tall &amp; thin. So if I find something that works for me, I buy them all up.

@semiotic_pirate I hate those interview bait &amp; switch tactics. Either you support WRFM or you don&#39;t.
@semiotic_pirate I think policies need to be consistent across the board at companies. Otherwise applicants/employees get mixed messages.
@semiotic_pirate I was fortunate to have WRFM flexibility the years I worked for companies, but some managers were less supportive.
@semiotic_pirate Now there is no way I could imagine being in an office for 35-40 hrs a week. I&#39;d die.

@d3bbie Ruff day, perhaps? ;-)
@Carl Between the two of us, there must be a moderately nice Spring or Fall day in there somewhere.
There&#39;s some serious wind blowing outside. And it&#39;s COLD. Not going anywhere if I can help it.
@semiotic_pirate A heated driveway? I would just love heated seats in my car!

@semiotic_pirate Cold, very windy and earlier it was raining. I am not cut out for that kind of weather.
