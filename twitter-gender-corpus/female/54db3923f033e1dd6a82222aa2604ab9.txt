@bbangie I&#39;ve got a Specialized Dolce &amp; I love it! On my last ride I saw many ladies on the same bike.   http://ow.ly/jaZ0x&nbsp;
@bbangie I&#39;m not completely sure if my bike is women specific but I tried a few and I liked that I was still a little upright in it.
@bbangie thanks! I&#39;m trying my hardest and that lady was a huge self-esteem suck. If I end up in her group again I&#39;ll request a switch
@feralization thank you! I&#39;m never sure if it&#39;s my insecurity or if people are being genuinely rude. I&#39;ve decided this lady was just rude.
@bbangie  I was on a hybrid before and I feel it&#39;s a good transition into road bikes. I also tried this guy: http://ow.ly/jb2uS&nbsp;
@feralization and that&#39;s why I decided to share. It&#39;s amazing what she did to my self esteem and determination. It was like I was punched
@bbangie so cool! New bike day is the best of all the days -- I&#39;m looking forward to the pics on Instagram :)
